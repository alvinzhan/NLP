# NLP
The Train.txt is the corpus of our program.
There are 4 modes for user to choose(strictly only 3 modes), because the mode 4 is the original corpus.
mode 1 is the corpus without prep.
mode 2 is the corpus without aux.
mode 3 is the corpus without both prep. and aux.

input: a pair of word
output: their similarity
