Dogs and cats have a range of interactions.


 The natural instincts of each species lead towards antagonistic interactions, though individual animals can have nonaggressive relationships with each other, particularly under conditions where humans have socialized nonaggressive behaviors.


The generally aggressive interactions between the species have been noted in cultural expressions.

The signals and behaviors that cats and dogs use to communicate are different and can lead to signals of aggression, fear, dominance, friendship or territoriality being misinterpreted by the other species.

 Dogs have a natural instinct to chase small prey that flee, an instinct common among cats.

 Most cats flee from a dog, while others take actions such as hissing, arching their backs and swiping at the dog.

 After being scratched by a cat, some dogs can become fearful of cats.

If appropriately socialized, cats and dogs may have relationships that are not antagonistic, and dogs raised with cats may prefer the presence of cats to other dogs.

 Even cats and dogs that have got along together in the same household may revert to aggressive reactions due to external stimuli, illness, or play that escalates.

The phrase "fight like cats and dogs" reflects a natural tendency for the relationship between the two species to be antagonistic.

 Other phrases and proverbs include "The cat is mighty dignified until the dog comes by" and "The cat and dog may kiss, but are none the better friends.

"A Russian legend explains the antipathy between dogs and cats by stating that the devil has tricked the dog and cat each into thinking the other has its rightful fur.

Eugene Field's children's poem, "The Duel," projects and amplifies the reallife antipathy between cats and dogs onto a stuffed gingham dog and a stuffed calico cat who had an allnight fight during which they "ate each other up.

" In Fam Ekman's children's book Kattens Skrekk (The Cat's Terror), a cat visits a museum to find that all of the artworks, like Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo, have been replaced by parodies featuring dogs.

 The only piece not converted is The Scream which "symbolizes the cat's terror in the face of so many dogs.

" The American animated television series CatDog featured the adventures of the protagonist, CatDog, a genetically altered creature that had the head of a dog on one side of its body and the head of a cat on the other.

 The episodes frequently played on "cats and dogs being what they are" to incorporate "a lot of running and chasing.

"The comedy films Cats & Dogs, released in 21, and Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, released in 21, both projected and amplified the abovementioned antipathy between dogs and cats into an allout war between the two species wherein cats are shown as being outandout enemies of humans, whereas dogs are shown as being more sympathetic to humans.

A wolfdog (also called a wolf¡Vdog hybrid or wolf hybrid) is a canid hybrid resulting from the hybridization of a domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) to one of four other Canis subspecies, the gray (Canis lupus), eastern timber (Canis lycaon), red (Canis rufus), and Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis).

Intrahybridization between dogs and other subspecies of gray wolves are the most common wolfdogs since dogs and gray wolves are considered the same species, are genetically very close, and have shared vast portions of their ranges for millennia.

 Such hybridization in the wild have been detected in many populations scattered throughout Europe and North America, usually occurring in areas where wolf populations have declined from human impacts and persecutions.

 At the same time, hybrids are also often bred in captivity for various purposes.

 Interhybridization of dogs and two other North American wolf species have also occurred historically in the wild, although it is often difficult for biologists to discriminate the dog genes in the eastern timber and red wolves from the gray wolf genes also present in these wolf species due to their historical overlaps with North American gray wolves as well as with coyotes, both of which have introgressed into the eastern timber and red wolf gene pools.

 At the same time, because many isolated populations of the three wolf species in North America have also mixed with coyotes in the wild, it has been speculated by some biologists that some of the coywolf hybrids in the northeastern third of the continent may also have both coydogs and wolfdogs in their gene pool.

 Hybrids between dogs and Ethiopian wolves discovered in the Ethiopian Highlands likely originated from past interactions between freeroaming feral dogs and Ethiopian wolves living in isolated areas.

The term "wolfdog" is preferred by most of the animals' proponents and breeders because the domestic dog was taxonomically recategorized in 13 as a subspecies of Canis lupus.

 The American Veterinary Medical Association and the United States Department of Agriculture refer to the animals as wolf¡Vdog hybrids.

Recognized wolfdog breeds by FCI are the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog and the Saarloos Wolfdog.

One of the issues that many researchers and wolfdog communities are faced with is identifying wolfdogs from pure dogs and any of the wolf species mixed into the hybrid.

 The most common method used by various wolfdog communities is phenotyping, a method that involves observing the animal's physical features.

 This method is often favoured for many in determining the degree of wolf and northern spitztype dog that is in a hybrid.

 However, a lot of criticisms have been made by opponents within some communities who tend to point out that phenotyping cannot always determine the wolfcontents accurately.

 Another challenge involves determining exactly the domestic breeds and wolf subspecies involved in the admixture due to the fact that dogs are known to come in various breeds while gray wolves in turn come in various subspecies with many different regional ecotypes hence have different physical features depending on the subspecies used in the breeding.

 Although wolves are often mixed with spitz types such as Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds, hybrids between wolves to nonSpitz type dogs such as Poodles, Pit bulls,1 and Great Pyrenees also exist, the latter hybrids often having less lupine features.

Prehistoric wolfdogsEvidence for prehistoric domesticated wolfdogs in the Americas dates back at least 1, years while fossil evidence in Europe points to their use in hunting mammoths.

Teotihuacan wolfdogsIn 21, experts announced that they had found the remains of many wolfdogs that had been kept by the warrior class of the Teotihuacan civilization in Mexico's central valley about two thousand years ago, and that, in light of this evidence, certain animals commonly depicted in the art of that culture, which had been thought to be strange dogs or coyotes, were likely instead wolfdogs.

North American gray wolfdomestic dog hybridsIn 18, the USDA estimated an approximate population of 3, wolfdogs in the United States (the highest of any country worldwide), with some other sources giving a population possibly as high as 5,.

 In firstgeneration hybrids, gray wolves are most often crossed with wolflike dogs (such as German Shepherds, Siberian Huskies, and Alaskan Malamutes) for an appearance most appealing to owners desiring an exotic pet.

British wolfdogsBritish wolfdogs, as illustrated in The Menageries: Quadrupeds Described and Drawn from Living Subjects by William Ogilby, 182The first record of wolfdog breeding in Great Britain comes from the year 1766 when what is thought was a male wolf mated with a dog identified in the language of the day as a "Pomeranian", although it may have differed from the modern Pomeranian breed.

 The union resulted in a litter of nine pups.

 Wolfdogs were occasionally purchased by English noblemen, who viewed them as a scientific curiosity.

 Wolfdogs were popular exhibits in British menageries and zoos.

Documented breedingCurrently, at least seven breeds of dog exist that acknowledge a significant amount of recent wolfdog hybridization in their creation.

 One breed is the "wolamute", aka "malawolf", a cross between an Alaskan Malamute and a timber wolf.

 Four breeds were the result of intentional crosses with German Shepherds (one of the original intentionally bred wolfdog crossbreeds), and have distinguishing characteristics of appearance that may reflect the varying subspecies of wolf that contributed to their foundation stock.

 Other, more unusual crosses have occurred; recent experiments in Germany were conducted in the crossing of wolves and Poodles.

 The intent behind creating the breeds has ranged widely from simply the desire for a recognizable companion highcontent wolfdog to professional military working dogs.

 Typical examples include:German ShepherdsThe breeding program that created the German Shepherd included wolfdogsAmong the dogs used in the development of the German Shepherd, at least four were either wolfdogs or partly descended from wolfdogs.

 In 18, Max von Stephanitz, an excavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein, who was allegedly onequarter wolf.

 Renamed Horand von Grafrath, the dog and his progeny were used to create the German Shepherd.

 Horand became the centrepoint of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits.

 Although fathering many pups, Horand's most successful was Hektor von Schwaben.

 Hektor was line bred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Beowulf, who later fathered a total of eightyfour pups, mostly through being line bred with Hektor's other offspring.

 In the original German Shepherd studbook, Zuchtbuch fur Deutsche Schaferhunde (SZ), within the two pages of entries from SZ No.

 41 to SZ No.

 76, there are four wolf crosses.

 This is the first documented use of pure wolf genes to create a domestic dog breed, the German Shepherd, which is historically thought to be the first documented intentionallybred wolfdog.

The Saarloos wolfdogThe Saarloos wolfdog traces its origins to the efforts of a Dutch breeder in 135.

 Leendert Saarloos who crossbred a German Shepherd male to either a female Mackenzie Valley wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis), or a female European wolf (Canis lupus lupus).

 He aimed for an improved version of the German Shepherd that would be immune to canine distemper.

 He succeeded insofar as the Saarloos Wolfdog known today is a strong, imposing breed that has kept its wolflike characteristics; it is cautious, reserved, and lacks the ferocity to attack.

 It is not, however, the dog that Leendert Saarloos hoped to get, as nearly all the firstgeneration hybrids succumbed to distemper.

 Until Leendert Saarloos died in 16, he was in full control over the breeding of his "European wolfdog".

 The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 175.

 To honor its creator they changed the name to "Saarloos Wolfdog".

 In 181 the breed was recognized by the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI).

 Some Saarloos Wolfdogs have been trained as guide dogs for the blind and as rescue dogs.

The Czechoslovakian WolfdogIn the 15s, the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog was also created to work on border patrol in the countries now known as Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

 It is recognized by the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the Federation Cynologique Internationale, and today is used in agility, obedience, search and rescue, police work, therapy work, and herding in Europe and the United States.

The Lupo ItalianoThe Lupo Italiano was created in 166 by crossing a wild wolf from northern Lazio with a German Shepherd.

1 Its maternal genetics and gestation was from the wild wolf.

2Currently, the breed is protected by presidential decree stipulating that this 'State' dog can not be commercialized nor bred outside the officially recognized agency, the Etli, Ente Tutela del Lupo Italiano (Agency for the protection of the Lupo Italiano).

The Hierran WolfdogThe Hierran Wolfdog originated in the Island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands (Spain).

 Although its origin is still uncertain, in the 15th century dogs similar to wolves already existed in the Canary Islands, called cancha by Aboriginals.

 At the arrival of the Spanish conquest, the chaplains accompanying the Conquistadors wrote about the presence of "wild dogs like wolves, but they are small".

 It is known that the Hierran Wolfdog has been present in the last two centuries and could have probably come up with the first settlers of the island.

 This species of dog has achieved its preference among the shepherds of the island.

Livestock guardian dogsA 214 study found that 2% of wolves and 37% of dogs shared the same mitochondrial haplotypes in Georgia.

 More than 13% of the studied wolves had detectable dog ancestry and more than 1% of the dogs had detectable wolf ancestry.

 The results of the study suggest that wolfdog hybridization is a common event in the areas where large livestock guardian dogs are held in a traditional way, and that gene flow between dogs and gray wolves was an important force influencing gene pool of dogs for millennia since early domestication events.

New World black wolvesGenetic research has shown that wolves with black pelts owe their coloration to a mutation that first arose in domestic dogsGenetic research from the Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of California, Los Angeles revealed that wolves with black pelts owe their distinctive coloration to a mutation that entered the wolf population through wolfdog hybridisation.

 Adolph Murie was among the first wolf biologists to speculate that the wide color variation in wolves was due to interbreeding with dogs.

In 28, Dr.

 Gregory S.

 Barsh, a professor of genetics and pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine used molecular genetic techniques to analyze DNA sequences from 15 wolves, half of them black, in Yellowstone National Park, which covers parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.

 It was discovered that a gene mutation responsible for the protein betadefensin 3, known as the K locus, is responsible for the black coat color in dogs.

2 After finding that the same mutation was responsible for black wolves in North America and the Italian Apennines, he set out to discover the origin of the mutation.

 Barsh and his colleagues concluded that the mutation arose in dogs 13, to 12, years ago, with a preferred date of 47, years ago after comparing large sections of wolf, dog, and coyote genomes.

 At the University of California, Los Angeles, Robert K.

 Wayne, a canine evolutionary biologist, stated that he believed that dogs were the first to have the mutation.

 He further stated that even if it originally arose in Eurasian wolves, it was passed on to dogs who, soon after their arrival, brought it to the New World and then passed it to wolves and coyotes.

3 Black wolves with recent dog ancestry tend to retain black pigment longer as they age.

Randombred wolfdogsCases of accidental breeding of wolfdogs are known (though this is very rare), where a domestic dog female in oestrus strays and is mated by a male wild wolf.

Breedspecific legislationThe wolfdog hybrid has been the center of controversy for much of its history, and most breedspecific legislation is either the result of the animal's perceived danger or its categorization as protected native wildlife.

 The Humane Society of the United States, the RSPCA, Ottawa Humane Society, the Dogs Trust and the Wolf Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission consider wolfdogs to be wild animals and therefore unsuitable as pets, and support an international ban on the private possession, breeding, and sale of wolfdogs.

According to the National Wolfdog Alliance, 4 U.

S.

 states effectively forbid the ownership, breeding, and importation of wolfdogs, while others impose some form of regulation upon ownership.

 In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island prohibit wolfdogs as pets.

 Most European nations have either outlawed the animal entirely or put restrictions on ownership.

 Wolfdogs were among the breeds banned from the U.

S.

 Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton and elsewhere after a fatal dog attack by a Pitbull on a child.

Wolfdogs in the wildHybridization in the wild usually occurs near human habitations where wolf density is low and dogs are common.

3 However, there were several reported cases of wolfdogs in areas with normal wolf densities in the former Soviet Union.

4 Wild wolfdogs were occasionally hunted by European aristocracy, and were termed lycisca to distinguish them from common wolves.

 Noted historic cases (such as the Beast of Gevaudan) of large wolves that were abnormally aggressive toward humans, may be attributable to wolfdog mating.

 In Europe, unintentional mating of dogs and wild wolves have been confirmed in some populations through genetic testing.

 As the survival of some Continental European wolf packs is severely threatened, scientists fear that the creation of wolfdog populations in the wild is a threat to the continued existence of European wolf populations.

 However, extensive wolf¡Vdog hybridization is not supported by morphological evidence, and analyses of mtDNA sequences have revealed that such mating are rare.

3 In 17, during the Mexican Wolf Arizona Reintroduction, controversy arose when a captive pack at Carlsbad designated for release was found to be largely composed of wolfdogs by Roy McBride, who had captured many wolves for the recovery programme in the 17s.

 Though staff initially argued that the animals' odd appearance was due to captivity and diet, it was later decided to euthanise them.

The physical characteristics of an animal created by breeding a wolf to a dog are not predictable, similar to that of mixedbreed dogs.

 Genetic research shows that wolf and dog populations initially diverged approximately 14, years ago and have interbred only occasionally since, accounting for the dissimilarity between dogs and wolves in behavior and appearance.

 In many cases the resulting adult wolfdog may be larger than either of its parents due to the genetic phenomenon of heterosis (commonly known as hybrid vigor).

 Breeding experiments in Germany with Poodles and wolves, and later on with the resulting wolfdogs showed unrestricted fertility, mating via free choice and no significant problems of communication (even after a few generations).

 The offspring of poodles with either coyotes and jackals however all showed a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic diseases after three generations of interbreeding between the hybrids.

 The researchers therefore concluded that domestic dogs and wolves are the same species.

Hybrids display a wide variety of appearances, ranging from a resemblance to dogs without wolf blood to animals that are often mistaken for fullblooded wolves.

 A lengthy study by DEFRA and the RSPCA found several examples of misrepresentation by breeders and indeterminate levels of actual wolf pedigree in many animals sold as wolfdogs.

 The report noted that uneducated citizens misidentify dogs with wolflike appearance as wolfdogs.

 Wolfdogs tend to have somewhat smaller heads than pure wolves, with larger, pointier ears that lack the dense fur commonly seen in those of wolves.

 Fur markings also tend to be very distinctive and not well blended.

 Black coloured hybrids tend to retain black pigment longer as they age, compared to black wolves.

 In some cases, the presence of dewclaws on the hind feet is considered a useful, but not absolute indicator of dog gene contamination in wild wolves.

 Dewclaws are the vestigial first toes, which are common on the hind legs of domestic dogs but thought absent from pure wolves, which only have four hind toes.

 Observations on wild wolf hybrids in the former Soviet Union indicate that wolf hybrids in a wild state may form larger packs than pure wolves, and have greater endurance when chasing prey.

 High wolfcontent hybrids typically have longer canine teeth than dogs of comparable size, with some officers in the South African Defence Force commenting that the animals are capable of biting through the toughest padding "like a knife through butter".

 Their sense of smell apparently rivals that of most established scenthounds.

 Tests undertaken in the Perm Institute of Interior Forces in Russia demonstrated that high wolfcontent hybrids took 15¡V2 seconds to track down a target in training sessions, whereas ordinary police dogs took three to four minutes.

HealthWolfdog hybrids are generally said to be naturally healthy animals, and are affected by fewer inherited diseases than most breeds of dog.

 Wolfdogs are usually healthier than either parent due to heterosis.

 Some of the established breeds of wolfdog that exist today were bred specifically to improve the health and vigor of working dogs.

There is some controversy over the effectiveness of the standard dog/cat rabies vaccine on a wolfdog.

 The USDA has not to date approved any rabies vaccine for use in wolfdog hybrids, though they do recommend an offlabel use of the vaccine.

 Wolfdog owners and breeders purport that the lack of official approval is a political move to prevent condoning wolfdog ownership.

4Temperament and behaviorWolfdog hybrids are a mixture of genetic traits, which results in less predictable behavior patterns compared to either the wolf or dog.

 The adult behavior of hybrid pups also cannot be predicted with comparable certainty to dog pups, even in thirdgeneration pups produced by wolfdog mating with dogs or from the behavior of the parent animals.

 Thus, though the behavior of a single individual wolf hybrid may be predictable, the behavior of the type as a whole is not.

 The majority of high wolfcontent hybrids are very curious and are generally no more destructive than any other curious or active dogs.

AggressionA wolf¡¦s behavior is typically more socially shy and timid toward humans than that of a dog.

 Due to the variability inherent to their hybridization, whether a wolf¡Vdog cross should be considered more dangerous than a dog depends on behavior specific to the individual alone rather than to wolfdogs as a group.

TrainabilityThe view that aggressive characteristics are inherently a part of wolfdog temperament has been contested in recent years by wolfdog breeders and other advocates of wolfdogs as pets.

 Proponents of wolfdogs as pets say that the higher wolfcontent animals are naturally timid and fearful of humans, but that with proper human association, training, and responsible ownership nearly all wolfdogs can become good companions, especially if their association and training begins at an early age.

 Even in cases of wolfdogs displaying consistently doglike behavior, they may occasionally retain some wolflike behavior such as digging dens, chewing up household items, climbing fences, and, to varying degrees, displaying some difficulty in housebreaking in relation to how high their wolf genetic content is.

 Low wolfcontent wolfdogs rarely have these problems any more strongly or significantly than any other largebreed dog.

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a canid in the genus Canis, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.

1 The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.

 The dog is the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

New research seems to show that the dog's high sociability may be affected by "the same genes as in humans.

" Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior1 and they are able to thrive on a starchrich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species.

2 Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.

 Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles.

 This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".

EtymologyThe term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties.

 The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".

 The term may possibly derive from ProtoGermanic *dukkn, represented in Old English fingerdocce ("fingermuscle").

 The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.

 Piotr Gsiorowski has suggested that Old English *docga is actually derived from Old English colour adjective dox.

In 14thcentury England, hound (from Old English: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff.

 It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category "hound".

 By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.

 The word "hound" is ultimately derived from the ProtoIndoEuropean word *kwon, "dog".

 This semantic shift may be compared with in German, where the corresponding words Dogge and Hund kept their original meanings.

 The term *won may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of ProtoIndoEuropean vocabulary.

2A male canine is referred to as a "dog", while a female is traditionally called a "bitch" (derived from Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja.

 Since the word "bitch" has taken on derogatory connotations, nowadays it is less commonly used to refer to dogs).

citation needed The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam.

 The process of birth is "whelping", from the Old English word hwelp; the modern English word "whelp" is an alternative term for puppy.

3 A litter refers to the multiple offspring at one birth which are called puppies or pups from the French poupee, "doll", which has mostly replaced the older term "whelp".

TerminologyThe term dog typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.

An adult female is a bitch.

An adult male capable of reproduction is a stud.

An adult female capable of reproduction is a brood bitch, or brood mother.

Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are pups or puppies.

A group of pups from the same gestation period is a litter.

The father of a litter is a sire.

 It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.

The mother of a litter is a dam.

A group of any three or more adults is a pack.

TaxonomyIn 1758, the taxonomist Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the classification of species.

 Canis is a Latin word meaning dog, and under this genus he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals.

 He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris (Linnaeus, 1758) and on the next page as a separate species he classified the wolf as Canis lupus (Linnaeus, 1758).

 In 126, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled in Opinion 1 that the domestic dog Canis familiaris (Linnaeus, 1758) be placed on its official list.

 In 157, the ICZN ruled in Opinion 451 that Canis dingo (Meyer, 173) was the name to be used for the dingo and that this be placed on its official list.

 These are the scientific names for the dog and dingo that appear on the Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology of the ICZN.

In 178, a review to minimize the number species listed under genus Canis proposed that "Canis dingo is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog.

 Canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with Canis lupus.

" In 182, the first edition of Mammal Species of the World included a note under Canis lupus with the comment: "Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, familiaris.

 Canis familiaris has page priority over Canis lupus, but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and Canis lupus has been universally used for this species".

 In the same year, an application was made to the ICZN to reclassify the dingo to Canis lupus dingo because it was proposed that the wolf (Canis lupus) was the ancestor of dogs and dingoes, however the application was rejected.

In 23, the ICZN ruled in its Opinion 227 that the "name of a wild species.

.

.

is not invalid by virtue of being predated by the name based on a domestic form.

" Additionally, the ICZN placed the taxon Canis lupus as a conserved name on the official list under this opinion.

 In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 25, the mammalogist W.

 Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus what he proposed to be two subspecies: "familiaris Linneaus, 1758 domestic dog" and "dingo Meyer, 173 domestic dog",a with the comment "Includes the domestic dog as a subspecies, with the dingo provisionally separate ¡V artificial variants created by domestication and selective breeding.

 Although this may stretch the subspecies concept, it retains the correct allocation of synonyms.

" Although the earliest use of the name "dingo" was Canis familiaris dingo (Blumenbach, 178),3 Wozencraft attributed it to Meyer from 173 without comment.

4This classification by Wozencraft is hotly debated by zoologists.

 Mathew Crowther, Stephen Jackson and Colin Groves disagree with Wozencraft and argue that based on ICZN Opinion 227, the implication is that a domestic animal cannot be a subspecies.

 Crowther, Juliet CluttonBrock and others argue that because the dingo differs from wolves by behavior, morphology, and that the dingo and dog do not fall genetically within any extant wolf clade, that the dingo should be considered the distinct taxon Canis dingo.

 Jackson and Groves regard the dog Canis familiaris as a taxonomic synonym for the wolf Canis lupus with them both equally ranked at the species level.

 They also disagree with Crowther, based on the overlap between dogs and dingoes in their morphology, in their ability to easily hybridize with each other, and that they show the signs of domestication by both having a cranium of smaller capacity than their progenitor, the wolf.

 Given that Canis familiaris (Linnaeus, 1758) has date priority over Canis dingo (Meyer, 173), they regard the dingo as a junior taxonomic synonym for the dog Canis familiaris.

 Gheorghe Benga and others support the dingo as a subspecies of the dog from the earlier Canis familiaris dingo (Blumenbach, 178).

 Xiaoming Wang and Richard H.

 Tedford proposed that the dog should be classified as Canis lupus familiaris under the Biological Species Concept and Canis familiaris under the Evolutionary Species Concept.

OriginMain article: Origin of the domestic dogThe origin of the domestic dog is not clear.

 It is known that the dog was the first domesticated species.

 The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolflike canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.

1 The closest living relative of the dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage.

 The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister clades, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.

 The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,7 years ago, with disputed remains occurring 36, years ago.

4 These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human huntergatherers and not agriculturists.

Where the genetic divergence of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia.

 This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,6,4 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,4 years ago.

AnatomyMain article: Dog anatomyDomestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

 Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.

 Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

Size and weightDogs are highly variable in height and weight.

 The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.

3 cm (2.

5 in) at the shoulder, .

5 cm (3.

7 in) in length along the headandbody, and weighed only 113 grams (4.

 oz).

 The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.

6 kg (343 lb) and was 25 cm (8 in) from the snout to the tail.

 The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 16.

7 cm (42.

 in) at the shoulder.

SensesThe dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field.

 Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.

CoatThe coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern.

 A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,6 which reduces its general visibility.

 Thus, many breeds will have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.

Regarding coat appearance or health, the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet, see Coat (dog) for more information.

TailSee also: DockingThere are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew.

 As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others.

 In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.

 In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.

HealthThere are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs including begonia, Poinsettia and aloe vera.

Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees.

 Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deepchested dogs.

 Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly.

 Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning), grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol, as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.

 The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous.

 Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes.

 Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.

g.

, from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea.

 Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.

6 Dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate.

 Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.

7LifespanA mixedbreed terrier.

 Mixedbreed dogs have been found to run faster and live longer than their purebred parents (See heterosis)In 213, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.

2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing bodyweight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.

e.

 the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).

The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 1 to 13 years.

 Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.

The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.

2 years, but several breeds, including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as shortlived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.

The longestlived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.

 The median longevity of mixedbreed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.

 The dog widely reported to be the longestlived is "Bluey", who died in 13 and was claimed to be 2.

5 years old at the time of his death.

 On 5 December 211, Pusuke, the world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of World Records, died aged 26 years and  months.

ReproductionMain article: Canine reproductionDog nursing newborn puppiesIn domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds.

 This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle.

 They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy.

 At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.

 Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.

Fertilization typically occurs 2¡V5 days after ovulation; 14¡V16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 78 more days the heart beat is detectable.

78Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary.

 An average litter consists of about six puppies, though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog.

 In general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.

Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction.

 Male French Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female.

 For many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.

NeuteringA feral dog from Sri Lanka nursing her four puppiesNeutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive.

 Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.

According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3¡V4 million dogs and cats are put down each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes.

 Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.

 Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.

Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.

 Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.

 However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs, and prostate cancer in males,8 as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.

Inbreeding depressionA common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.

g.

 between half and full siblings).

 In a study of seven different French breeds of dogs (Bernese mountain dog, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Epagneul Breton, German Shepherd dog, Leonberger, and West Highland white terrier) it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.

 Another analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters, found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.

About 22% of boxer puppies die before reaching 7 weeks of age.

 Stillbirth is the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection.

 Mortality due to infection was found to increase significantly with increases in inbreeding.

 Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.

 Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.

Intelligence, behavior and communicationIntelligenceMain article: Dog intelligenceDog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems.

 Dogs have been shown to learn by inference.

 A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 2 different items.

 He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure.

 Dogs have advanced memory skills.

 A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, "Chaser", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1, words.

 Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands.

 Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.

 An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in nonsocial problemsolving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problemsolving abilities once they joined humans.

 Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.

 Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them.

1BehaviorMain article: Dog behaviorDog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli.

 As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from ,¡V3, years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans.

 As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.

1 Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of socialcognitive abilities in the domestic dog.

 These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the socialcognitive skills of human children.

 Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to WilliamsBeuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem solving ability.

CommunicationMain article: Dog communicationDog communication is about how dogs "speak" to each other, how they understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit.

:xii These communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste).

 Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body posture.

Comparison with wolvesThe Saarloos wolfdog carries more gray wolf DNA than any other dog breedPhysical characteristicsDespite their close genetic relationship and the ability to interbreed, there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs.

 Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase.

 The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled.

 Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 2% smaller skulls and 3% smaller brains.

 The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs.

1 Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive "stop" between forehead and nose.

11 The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves.

:p158 Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them.

 Most dogs lack a functioning precaudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year.

 Socalled primitive dogs such as Dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle.

 Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes.

 The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.

 The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.

 For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a 6 inches (15 mm) in the Chihuahua to 3.

3 feet (1.

 m) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarsehaired to woollike, straight, curly, or smooth.

 It is common for most breeds to shed their coat.

Behavioral differencesSee also: Dog behavior ¡± Behavior compared with other canidsUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for productionrelated traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.

1112 In 216, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs.

 These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication.

 These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fightorflight response (i.

e.

 selection for tameness), and emotional processing.

12 Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.

 Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.

12EcologyPopulation and habitatThe global dog population is estimated at  million and rising.

 Although it is said that the "dog is man's best friend" regarding 17¡V24% of dogs in developed countries, in the developing world they are feral, village or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.

 Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively.

 (11%).

 Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, stray or are in shelters, as the majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.

CompetitorsBeing the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and freeranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with other carnivores.

 A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.

 Competition would favor the wolf as it is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.

12Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together.

13 One survey claims that in Wisconsin in 1 more compensation had been paid for dog losses than livestock, however in Wisconsin wolves will often kill hunting dogs, perhaps because they are in the wolf's territory.

13 Some wolf pairs have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal waits in ambush.

 In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.

 Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs.

 In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members.

 The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.

Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs.

 Leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of their size or ferocity.

 Tigers in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards.

 Striped hyenas are major predators of stray dogs in Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.

The spiked collar common on working and pet dogs is no mere ornament: it originated as a protection of the vulnerable neck of a dog from wolves, but also protects dogs from attacks by other dogs.

better source neededDietSee also: Dog foodGolden Retriever gnawing a pig's footDespite their descent from wolves and classification as Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores.

 Unlike obligate carnivores, dogs can adapt to a wideranging diet, and are not dependent on meatspecific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements.

 Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet, however allmeat diets are not recommended for dogs due to their lack of calcium and iron.

 Comparing dogs and wolves, dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starchrich diet.

2BreedsMain article: Dog breedFurther information: Dog typeCavalier King Charles Spaniels demonstrate different colored coats within the one breedMost breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles.

 Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.

 For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.

2 centimetres (6.

 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (3 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarsehaired to woollike, straight, curly, or smooth.

 It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.

While all dogs are genetically very similar, natural selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving rise to dog types and dog breeds.

 Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics.

 Dog breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals within the same species.

vaguecitation needed Modern dog breeds are nonscientific classifications of dogs kept by modern kennel clubs.

Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds, but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic.

 DNA microsatellite analyses of 85 dog breeds showed they fell into four major types of dogs that were statistically distinct.

 These include the "old world dogs" (e.

g.

, Malamute and Shar Pei), "Mastiff"type (e.

g.

, English Mastiff), "herding"type (e.

g.

, Border Collie), and "all others" (also called "modern" or "hunting"type).

Roles with humansGunnar Kaasen and Balto, the lead dog on the last relay team of the 125 serum run to Nome.

Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language.

 These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.

:pages5136The dogs' value to early human huntergatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures.

 Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals.

 This influence on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world.

 In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.

Early rolesWolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps¡Xmore safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.

14 They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.

14 Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.

14The dogs of Thibet are twice the size of those seen in India, with large heads and hairy bodies.

 They are powerful animals, and are said to be able to kill a tiger.

 During the day they are kept chained up, and are let loose at night to guard their masters' house.

15Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.

 For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.

 Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.

Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt.

 The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 24 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.

The cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.

Emigrants from Siberia that walked across the Bering land bridge into North America may have had dogs in their company, and one writer suggests that the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12, years ago, although the earliest archaeological evidence of doglike canids in North America dates from about ,4 years ago.

: Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal.

 Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,4 years ago.

 Use of dogs as pack animals in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to North America.

It is estimated that threequarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.

"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.

 (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12, BC, the remains of an elderly human and a fourtofivemonthold puppy were found buried together).

 However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.

 In the 15s and 16s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today15 (using the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion.

 From the 18s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.

16 People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives, to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.

There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs.

 The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.

 The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogsasdogs within everyday routines and practices.

There are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.

 The list of goods, services and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.

 While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 2th century it became a highprofile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking (which dogs do to establish territory through scent), became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.

 Dog training books, classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.

The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog¡Vhuman family as a pack.

 A dominance model of dog¡Vhuman relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer.

 However it has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of dog¡Vhuman interactions.

 Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog¡Vhuman families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions with each other.

Increasingly, human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.

According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2¡V21, it is estimated there are 77.

5 million people with pet dogs in the United States.

 The same survey shows nearly 4% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly % more than two dogs.

 There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets.

 Yet, although several programs are ongoing to promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.

The latest study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) comparing humans and dogs showed that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do.

 This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.

16WorkDogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname, "man's best friend",17 a phrase used in other languages as well.

 They have been bred for herding livestock, hunting (e.

g.

 pointers and hounds), rodent control, guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as companions.

 Some dogs owned by epileptics have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.

Dogs included in human activities in terms of helping out humans are usually called working dogs.

Sports and showsSee also: Conformation showDogs come in a range of sizes.

People often enter their dogs in competitions such as breedconformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard.

 As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

As foodMain article: Dog meatGaegogi (dog meat) stew being served in a Korean restaurantDog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity.

 It is estimated that 13¡V16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year.

17 Other cultures, such as Polynesia and preColumbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history.

 However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as taboo.

 In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties¡Xbeing good for the lungs for instance.

18 Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.

 Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy, and that there is no difference with eating the meat of different animals.

In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the nureongi (), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.

The most popular Korean dog dish is gaejangguk (also called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi, or vital energy of the body.

 A 1th century version of gaejangguk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder.

 Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots.

 While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.

Health benefits for humansSmall dog laying between the handsA human cuddles a Doberman puppy.

The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing.

 Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing have been criticised for being poorly controlled, and finding that "the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal.

" Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than nonguardians.

A 25 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people.

 Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets.

" In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.

In addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets.

 The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively longterm.

 Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.

The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets.

 For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.

2 Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immunestimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases.

 The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.

21 One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not.

 In 215, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than nonpet owners.

The practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.

 Animalassisted intervention research has shown that animalassisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease.

 One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those who were not in an animalassisted program.

Medical detection dogsMedical detection dogs are capable of detecting diseases by sniffing a person directly or samples of urine or other specimens.

 Dogs can detect odour in one part per trillion, as their brain's olfactory cortex is (relative to total brain size) 4 times larger than humans.

 Dogs may have as many as 3 million odour receptors in their nose, while humans may have only 5 million.

 Each dog is trained specifically for the detection of single disease from the blood glucose level indicative to diabetes to cancer.

 The process of training a cancer dog requires six months.

 A Labrador Retriever called Daisy has detected 551 cancer patients with an accuracy of 3 percent and received the Blue Cross (for pets) Medal for her lifesaving skills.

SheltersMain article: Animal shelterEvery year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter US animal shelters.

 The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the United States.

 However, the percentage of dogs in US animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the mid1s from around 25% to a 212 average of 4% among reporting shelters21 (with many shelters reporting 6¡V75%).

The gray wolf (Canis lupus),a also known as the timber wolf or western wolf,b is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America.

 It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43¡V45 kg (5¡V lb) and females 36¡V38.

5 kg (7¡V85 lb).

 Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle.

 Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, and brown to black also occur.

 Mammal Species of the World (3rd ed.

, 25), a standard reference work in zoology, recognises 38 subspecies of C.

 lupus.

.

Gray wolfs are pack hunters.

The gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior.

 It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids.

 It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean.

 It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.

 The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it.

 It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.

The gray wolf is one of the world's bestknown and mostresearched animals, with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species.

1 It has a long history of association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and huntergatherer societies.

2 Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies.

 Nonrabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.

EtymologyThe English 'wolf' stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the ProtoGermanic *wulfaz.

 The Latin lupus is a Sabine loanword.

2 Both derive from the ProtoIndoEuropean root *wlqwos/*lukwos.

Taxonomy and evolutionTaxonomyMain article: Subspecies of Canis lupusThe species Canis lupus was first recorded by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758, with the Latin classification translating into the English words "dog wolf".

 The thirtyseven subspecies of Canis lupus are listed under the designated common name of "wolf" in Mammal Species of the World third edition that was published in 25.

 The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), also known as the common wolf.

 The subspecies includes the domestic dog, dingo, eastern wolf and red wolf, but lists C.

 l.

 italicus and C.

 l.

 communis as synonyms of C.

 l.

 lupus.

 However, the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged.

Evolution and relationship with the dogMain article: Evolution of the wolfArtist's impression of a Beringian wolfThe evolution of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 8, years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today's dog, dingo, and gray wolf.

 Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic population structure and craniodental plasticity.

 Wolves went through a population bottleneck 2, years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct at a time that coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game.

 The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore, and a descendant of one of those nowextinct wolf populations.

Population structureIn 213, a genetic study found that the wolf population in Europe was divided along a northsouth axis and formed five major clusters.

 Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the DinaricBalkans, the Carpathians.

 Another two clusters were identified occupying northcentral Europe and the Ukrainian steppe.

 The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity.

 Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the DinaricBalkans cluster.

 Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the northcentral Europe cluster, with wolves from the Carpathians cluster coming from a mixture of wolves from the northcentral cluster and the DinaricBalkans cluster.

 The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the PonticCaspian Steppe than they were to wolves from northcentral Europe.

 These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.

In 216, two genetic studies of North American gray wolves found that they formed six ecotypes ¡V genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat.

 These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia.

 The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables.

 These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences.

 The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into.

Hybridization with other CanisMain article: Canid hybridF1 wolfdog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.

 The first is the product of a male wolf and a female spaniel, while the latter comes from a female wolf and a male West Siberian LaikaIt was once thought that dogs and gray wolves did not voluntarily interbreed in the wild, though they can produce fertile wolfdog offspring.

 In 21, a study of 74 Italian wolf male lineages found that 5 of them originated from dog ancestry, indicating that female wolves will breed with stray male dogs in the wild.

2 In North America, black colored wolves acquired their coloration from wolfdog hybridization, which occurred 1,¡V15, years ago.

3 Like pure wolves, hybrids breed once annually, though their mating season occurs three months earlier, with pups mostly being born in the winter period, thus lessening their chances of survival.

 However, one genetic study undertaken in the Caucasus Mountains showed that as many as 1% of dogs in the area, including livestock guardian dogs, are first generation hybrids.

 The captive breeding of wolfdog hybrids has proliferated in the USA, with 3, such animals being present there.

The gray wolf has interbred extensively with the eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves.

 Unlike the red and eastern wolf, the gray wolf does not readily interbreed with coyotes.

 Nevertheless, coyote genetic markers have been found in some wild isolated gray wolf populations in the southern United States.

 Gray wolf Ychromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes.

 In tests performed on a Texan canid of ambiguous species, mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote¡Vgray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf.

 In 213, a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination, making this the first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves.

 At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species.

 Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria.

 Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolfjackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolflike phenotypes, to the point of being mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.

Physical descriptionAnatomy and dimensionsDifferences between gray wolf and coyoteGray wolf skeletonWolf mandible diagram showing the names and positions of the teeth.

The gray wolf is the largest extant member of the Canidae, excepting certain large breeds of domestic dog.

 Gray wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide, tending to increase proportionally with latitude as predicted by Bergmann's Rule, with the large wolves of Alaska and Canada sometimes weighing 3¡V6 times more than their Middle Eastern and South Asian cousins.

 On average, adult wolves measure 15¡V16 cm (41¡V63 in) in length and 8¡V85 cm (31¡V33 in) in shoulder height.

 The tail measures 2¡V5 cm (11¡V2 in) in length.

 The ears are ¡V11 mm (3.

5¡V4.

3 in) in height, and the hind feet are 22¡V25 mm (8.

7¡V.

8 in).

 The mean body mass of the extant gray wolf is 4 kg (88 lb), with the smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg (26 lb) and the largest at 8 kg (18 lb).

 Gray wolf weight varies geographically; on average, European wolves may weigh 38.

5 kg (85 lb), North American wolves 36 kg (7 lb) and Indian and Arabian wolves 25 kg (55 lb).

 Females in any given wolf population typically weigh 5¡V1 lb (2.

3¡V4.

5 kg) less than males.

 Wolves weighing over 54 kg (11 lb) are uncommon, though exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in Alaska, Canada, and the forests of western Russia.

 The heaviest recorded gray wolf in North America was killed on 7 Mile River in eastcentral Alaska on July 12, 13 and weighed 7.

4 kg (175 lb).

Compared to its closest wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail.

 It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply descending ribcage, a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck.

 The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range.

 The ears are relatively small and triangular.

 Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.

The gray wolf usually carries its head at the same level as the back, raising it only when alert.

 It usually travels at a loping pace, placing its paws one directly in front of the other.

 This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8¡V km/h (5.

¡V5.

6 mph), and allows the wolf to cover great distances.

 On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 5¡V6 km/h (31¡V37 mph).

 The gray wolf has a running gait of 55¡V7 km/h (34¡V43 mph), can leap 5 m (16 ft) horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 2 minutes.

Skull and dentitionThe gray wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle.

 The skull averages 23¡V28 mm (.

1¡V11.

 in) in length, and 13¡V15 mm (5.

1¡V5.

 in) wide.

4 The teeth are heavy and large, being better suited to crushing bone than those of other extant canids, though not as specialised as those found in hyenas.

 Its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter.

 The gray wolf's jaws can exert a crushing pressure of perhaps 1,34 kPa (1,5 psi) compared to 5,2 kPa (75 psi) for a German shepherd.

 This force is sufficient to break open most bones.

 A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators when adjusted for the body mass found that for placental mammals, the bite force at the canines (in Newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the extinct dire wolf (163), then followed among the extant canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (18).

See also: Dog anatomyFurBlack and whitefurred gray wolvesThe gray wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur, with short underfur and long, coarse guard hairs.

 Most of the underfur and some of the guard hairs are shed in the spring and grow back in the autumn period.

 The longest hairs occur on the back, particularly on the front quarters and neck.

 Especially long hairs are on the shoulders, and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck.

 The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts.

 The ears are covered in short hairs, which strongly project from the fur.

 Short, elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbows down to the calcaneal tendons.

 The winter fur is highly resistant to cold; wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at 4¢X by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail.

 Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it.

 In warm climates, the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves.

 Female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males, and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age.

 Older wolves generally have more white hairs in the tip of the tail, along the nose and on the forehead.

 The winter fur is retained longest in lactating females, though with some hair loss around their nipples.

 Hair length on the middle of the back is 6¡V7 mm (2.

4¡V2.

8 in).

 Hair length of the guard hairs on the shoulders generally does not exceed  mm (3.

5 in), but can reach 11¡V13 mm (4.

3¡V5.

1 in).

Coat color ranges from almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with variation in fur color tending to increase in higher latitudes.

 Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones.

 Blackcolored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs,3 while the mutation was found to be naturally occurring in wolves from Iran.

 Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with about half the wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black.

3BehaviorSee also: Dog behaviorSocial and territorial behaviorsGray wolf packThe gray wolf is a social animal, whose basic social unit consists of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.

c The average pack consists of a family of 5¡V11 animals (1¡V2 adults, 3¡V6 juveniles and 1¡V3 yearlings), or sometimes two or three such families, with exceptionally large packs consisting of up to 42 wolves being known.

5 In ideal conditions, the mated pair produces pups every year, with such offspring typically staying in the pack for 1¡V54 months before dispersing.

 Triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food.

6 The distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely; some stay in the vicinity of the parental group, while other individuals may travel great distances of 26 km (128 mi), 3 km (24 mi), and 67 km (42 mi) from their natal packs.

 A new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female, travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs.

 Wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold, and typically kill them.

 In the rare cases where other wolves are adopted, the adoptee is almost invariably an immature animal (1¡V3 years of age) unlikely to compete for breeding rights with the mated pair.

 In some cases, a lone wolf is adopted into a pack to replace a deceased breeder.

5 During times of ungulate abundance (migration, calving etc.

), different wolf packs may temporarily join forces.

Wolves are highly territorial animals, and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive in order to assure a steady supply of prey.

 Territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available and the age of the pack's pups, tending to increase in size in areas with low prey populations or when the pups reach the age of 6 months, thus having the same nutritional needs as adults.

 Wolf packs travel constantly in search of prey, covering roughly % of their territory per day (average 25 km/d (16 mi/d)).

 The core of their territory is on average 35 km2 (14 sq mi), in which they spend 5% of their time.

 Prey density tends to be much higher in the territory's surrounding areas, though wolves tend to avoid hunting in the fringes of their range unless desperate, because of the possibility of fatal encounters with neighboring packs.

 The smallest territory on record was held by a pack of six wolves in northeastern Minnesota, which occupied an estimated 33 km2 (13 sq mi), while the largest was held by an Alaskan pack of ten wolves encompassing a 6,272 km2 (2,422 sq mi) area.

 Wolf packs are typically settled, and usually only leave their accustomed ranges during severe food shortages.

Wolves defend their territories from other packs through a combination of scent marking, direct attacks and howling (see Communication).

 Scent marking is used for territorial advertisement, and involves urination, defecation and ground scratching.

6 Scent marks are generally left every 24 m (26 yd) throughout the territory on regular travelways and junctions.

 Such markers can last for 2¡V3 weeks, and are typically placed near rocks, boulders, trees, or the skeletons of large animals.

 Territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality, with one study concluding that 14¡V65% of wolf deaths in Minnesota and the Denali National Park and Preserve were due to predation by other wolves.

7Reproduction and developmentSee also: Canine reproductionGray wolves matingThe gray wolf is generally monogamous, with mated pairs usually remaining together for life.

 Upon the death of one mated wolf, pairs are quickly reestablished.

 Since males often predominate in any given wolf population, unpaired females are a rarity.

 If a dispersing male gray wolf is unable to establish a territory or find a mate, he mates with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs.

 Such gray wolves are termed "Casanova wolves" and, unlike males from established packs, they do not form pair bonds with the females they mate with.

 Some gray wolf packs may have multiple breeding females this way, as is the case in Yellowstone National Park.

 Gray wolves also practice alloparental care, in which a wolf pair may adopt the pup or pups of another.

 This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them.

 In addition to heterosexual behavior, homosexual behavior has been observed in gray wolves.

 Male gray wolves often mount each other when the highest ranking female in the pack comes into heat.

Illustration of various gray wolf growth stagesThe age of first breeding in gray wolves depends largely on environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages in order to better exploit abundant resources.

 This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach ¡V1 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old.

 Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average.

 Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence.

 Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2¡V3 weeks earlier than younger females.

 During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely.

 Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace.

 The gestation period lasts 62¡V75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.

Wolves bear relatively large pups in small litters compared to other canid species.

 The average litter consists of 5¡V6 pups,7 with litter sizes tending to increase in areas where prey is abundant,7 though exceptionally large litters of 14¡V17 pups occur only 1% of the time.

8 Pups are usually born in spring, coinciding with a corresponding increase in prey populations.

 Pups are born blind and deaf, and are covered in short soft grayishbrown fur.

 They weigh 3¡V5 g (11¡V18 oz) at birth, and begin to see after ¡V12 days.

 The milk canines erupt after one month.

 Pups first leave the den after 3 weeks.

 At 1.

5 months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger.

 Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young.

 Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of 3¡V4 weeks.

 Pups have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 3 times.

 Wolf pups begin play fighting at the age of 3 weeks, though unlike young foxes and coyotes, their bites are inhibited.

 Actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at 5¡V8 weeks of age.

 This is in contrast to young foxes and coyotes, which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behavior.

1 By autumn, the pups are mature enough to accompany adults on hunts for large prey.

Hunting and feeding behaviorsAmerican bison standing its ground, thereby increasing its chance of survivalGray wolf trotting.

 The gray wolf generally places its hind paws in the tracks made by the front paws.

Although social animals, single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs, with single wolves having occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and muskoxen unaided.

 The gray wolf's sense of smell is relatively weakly developed when compared to that of some hunting dog breeds, being able to detect carrion upwind no farther than 2¡V3 kilometres (1.

2¡V1.

 mi).

 Because of this, it rarely manages to capture hidden hares or birds, though it can easily follow fresh tracks.

 Its auditory perception is acute enough to be able to hear up to a frequency of 26 kHz, which is sufficient to register the fall of leaves in the autumn period.

 A gray wolf hunt can be divided into five stages:Locating prey: The wolves travel in search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking.

 Wolves typically locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it.

 When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target.

 In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nosetonose and wagging their tails.

 Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.

The stalk: The wolves attempt to conceal themselves as they approach.

 As the gap between the wolves and their prey closes, the wolves quicken their pace, wag their tails, and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.

The encounter: Once the prey detects the wolves, it can either approach the wolves, stand its ground, or flee.

 Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground.

 Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal to proceed with an attack.

 If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.

The rush: If the prey attempts to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it.

 This is the most critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed.

 If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt to break up the herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.

The chase: A continuation of the rush, the wolves attempt to catch up with their prey and kill it.

 When chasing small prey, wolves attempt to catch up with their prey as soon as possible, while with larger animals, the chase is prolonged, in order to wear the selected prey out.

 Wolves usually give up chases after 1¡V2 km (.

62¡V1.

3 mi), though one wolf was recorded to chase a deer for 21 km (13 mi).

 Both Russian and North American wolves have been observed to drive prey onto crusted ice, precipices, ravines, slopes and steep banks to slow them down.

8Killing a moose in typical fashion: biting the hindquartersThe actual killing method varies according to prey species.

 With large prey, mature wolves usually avoid attacking frontally, instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal.

 Large prey, such as moose, is killed by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft perineum area, causing massive blood loss.

 Such bites can cause wounds 1¡V15 cm (3.

¡V5.

 in) in length, with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health.

8 With mediumsized prey such as roe deer or sheep, wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery, thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute.

 With small, mouselike prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws.

 When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally surplus kill.

 Such instances are common in domestic animals, but rare in the wild.

 In the wild, surplus killing primarily occurs during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey) or during the denning period, when wolves require a ready supply of meat when denbound.

 Mediumsized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throatbiting method by which they are killed allows wolves to quickly kill one animal and move on to another.

Two gray wolves eating a whitetailed deerOnce prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.

 The breeding pair typically monopolizes food in order to continue producing pups.

 When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially nonpups.

 The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested.

 Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace.

 Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining.

 The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.

 A single wolf can eat 15¡V1% of its body weight in a single feeding.

CommunicationVisualThe gray wolf's expressive behavior is more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits.

 While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity.

 When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction.

 Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection.

 Aggressive, or selfassertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail.

 When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine.

 Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active.

 Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area.

 Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face.

1 When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking.

 The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.

Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color patterns in which the gaze direction can be easily identified, although this is often not the case in other canid species.

 In 214, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species.

 The results suggested that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.

Facial expressions (Konrad Lorenz, 152).

Rallying cryMENU:Problems playing this file See media help.

Gray wolves howl to assemble the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances.

 Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to 13 km2 (5 sq mi).

 Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs.

 Male wolves give voice through an octave, passing to a deep bass with a stress on "O", while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on "U".

 Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending in a series of doglike yelps.

 Howling consists of a fundamental frequency that may lie between 15 and 78 Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones.

 The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times.

 Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar to the beginning of the cry of a horned owl.

 When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes.

 When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl.

 When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are.

 Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present.

 Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable.

 The two are however mutually intelligible, as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to Europeanstyle howls made by biologists.

Other vocalisations of wolves are usually divided into three categories: growls, barks and whines.

 Barking has a fundamental frequency between 32¡V4 Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves.

 Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark a few times and retreat from perceived danger.

 Growling has a fundamental frequency of 38¡V45 Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges.

 Pups commonly growl when playing.

 One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack.

 Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.

OlfactoryGray wolf marking its territory with urineOlfaction is probably the wolf's most acute sense, and plays a fundamental role in communication.

 The wolf has a large number of apocrine sweat glands on the face, lips, back, and between the toes.

 The odor produced by these glands varies according to the individual wolf's microflora and diet, giving each a distinct "odor fingerprint".

 A combination of apocrine and eccrine sweat glands on the feet allows the wolf to deposit its scent whilst scratching the ground, which usually occurs after urine marking and defecation during the breeding season.

 The follicles present on the guard hairs from the wolf's back have clusters of apocrine and sebaceous glands at their bases.

 As the skin on the back is usually folded, this provides a microclimate for bacterial propagation around the glands.

 During piloerection, the guard hairs on the back are raised and the skin folds spread, thus releasing scent.

 The precaudal scent glands may play a role in expressing aggression, as combative wolves raise the base of their tails whilst drooping the tip, thus positioning the scent glands at the highest point.

 The wolf possesses a pair of anal sacs beneath the rectum, which contain both apocrine and sebaceous glands.

 The components of anal sac secretions vary according to season and gender, thus indicating that the secretions provide information related to gender and reproductive state.

 The secretions of the preputial glands may advertise hormonal condition or social position, as dominant wolves have been observed to stand over subordinates, apparently presenting the genital area for investigation, which may include genital licking.

1 During the breeding season, female wolves secrete substances from the vagina, which communicate the females' reproductive state, and can be detected by males from long distances.

 Urine marking is the beststudied means of olfactory communication in wolves.

 Its exact function is debated, though most researchers agree that its primary purpose is to establish boundaries.

 Wolves urine mark more frequently and vigorously in unfamiliar areas, or areas of intrusion, where the scent of other wolves or canids is present.

 Socalled raised leg urination (RLU) is more common in male wolves than in females, and may serve the purpose of maximizing the possibility of detection by conspecifics, as well as reflect the height of the marking wolf.

 Only dominant wolves typically use RLU, with subordinate males continuing to use the juvenile standing posture throughout adulthood.

 RLU is considered to be one of the most important forms of scent communication in the wolf, making up 6¡V8% of all scent marks observed.

11EcologyHabitatGray wolf carrying caribou hindquarter, Denali National ParkThe gray wolf is a habitat generalist, and can occur in deserts, grasslands, forests and arctic tundras.

 Habitat use by gray wolves is strongly correlated with the abundance of prey, snow conditions, absence or low livestock densities, road densities, human presence and topography.

 In cold climates, the gray wolf can reduce the flow of blood near its skin to conserve body heat.

 The warmth of the footpads is regulated independently of the rest of the body, and is maintained at just above tissuefreezing point where the pads come in contact with ice and snow.

 Gray wolves use different places for their diurnal rest: places with cover are preferred during cold, damp and windy weather, while wolves in dry, calm and warm weather readily rest in the open.

 During the autumnspring period, when wolves are more active, they willingly lie out in the open, whatever their location.

 Actual dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period.

 When building dens, females make use of natural shelters such as fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation.

 Sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots.

 An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade.

 On rare occasions, female wolves dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with 1¡V3 openings.

 The den is usually constructed not more than 5 m (55 yd) away from a water source, and typically faces southwards, thus ensuring enough sunlight exposure, keeping the denning area relatively snow free.

 Resting places, play areas for the pups and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens.

 The odour of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds such as magpies and ravens.

 As there are few convenient places for burrows, wolf dens are usually occupied by animals of the same family.

 Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near domiciles, paved roads and railways.

DietGlobally, gray wolf diet is predominantly composed of large (24¡V65 kg (53¡V1,43 lb)) and mediumsized (23¡V13 kg (51¡V287 lb)) wild ungulates, with local population variations due to the mix of wild ungulates, smaller prey and domestic species consumed.

 All terrestrial mammalian social predators feed predominantly on terrestrial herbivorous mammals that have a body mass similar to that of the combined mass of the social group members.

 The gray wolf generally specializes in predating on the vulnerable individuals of large prey, with pack of timber wolves capable of bringing down a 5 kg (1,1 lb) moose.

 Digestion only takes a few hours, thus wolves can feed several times in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.

Although wolves primarily feed on medium to large sized ungulates, they are not fussy eaters.

 Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores.

 They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs.

 When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available.

 In times of scarcity, wolves readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses.

 Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves: during harsh winters, packs often attack weak or injured wolves, and may eat the bodies of dead pack members.

 Wolf packs in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline11 and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon.

12 Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon.

 Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.

In Eurasia, many gray wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on livestock and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe.

 Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer.

 The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional.

 Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, whitetailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.

Wolves supplement their diet with fruit and vegetable matter.

 They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry.

 Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears.

 They readily visit melon fields during the summer months.

 A wellfed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.

Enemies and competitorsGray wolves attacking brown bear with cubsGray wolves confronting coyotes over pronghorn carcass (11), Louis Agassiz FuertesGray wolves typically dominate other canid species in areas where they both occur.

 In North America, incidents of gray wolves killing coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills.

 Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them.

 There are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them.

 Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between gray wolves and golden jackals, with the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities.

 Gray wolves are the most important predator of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in the spring and summer periods.

 Wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them.

 In Asia, they may compete with dholes, though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary.

12Brown bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites.

 Both species kill each other's young.

 Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves.

13 Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with brown bears, because of differences in habitat preferences.

 The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico.

 Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them.

 Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills.

 While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common, polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs.

 Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.

Wolves may encounter striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses.

 Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolfkilled carcasses in areas where the two species interact.

 Onetoone, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas.

 However, there was a case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves.

 Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.

Large wolf populations limit the numbers of small to mediumsized felines.

 Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges.

 Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations.

 In winter, however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely.

 Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills.

 They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens.

13 Wolves hunt steppe cats, and may scavenge from snow leopard kills.

 Wolves may also reduce Eurasian lynx populations.

 Wolves may kill lynxes by running them down, or killing them before they can escape into trees.

 Similar reports of encounters between wolves and bobcats have been documented.

Leftovers of wolf kills are sometimes scavenged by wolverines.

 Wolverines usually wait until the wolves are done feeding, but have been known to drive away wolves from kills.

 However, there have been confirmed reports of wolf packs killing wolverines.

Other than humans, tigers appear to be the only serious predators of wolves.

14 Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in SikhoteAlin, where tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem.

 Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers.

 Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.

Range and conservationMain article: List of grey wolf populations by countrySee also: History of wolves in Yellowstone, Wolves in Great Britain, and Wolves in IrelandThe gray wolf was once one of the world's most widely distributed mammals, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15¢XN latitude in North America and 12¢XN in India.

 However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans.

 The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the United States.

 In modern times, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75¢XN to 12¢XN.

 Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 17s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in landuse and rural human population shifts to cities.

 Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species.

 Despite these threats, because of the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population, it is classified as least concern by the IUCN.

EuropeDeclinePolychrome cave painting of a gray wolf, FontdeGaume, FranceAlthough wolfdog hybridization in Europe has raised concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does not pose a significant threat.

 Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.

The extermination of Northern Europe's wolves first became an organized effort during the Middle Ages, and continued until the late 18s.

 In England, wolf persecution was enforced by legislation, and the last wolf was killed in the early sixteenth century during the reign of Henry VII.

 Wolves lasted longer in Scotland, where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest, which were subsequently burned down.

 Wolves managed to survive in the forests of Braemar and Sutherland until 1684.

 The extirpation of wolves in Ireland followed a similar course, with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786.

 A wolf bounty was introduced in Sweden in 1647, after the extermination of moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock.

 The Sami extirpated wolves in northern Sweden in organized drives.

 By 16, few wolves remained in Sweden, because of the use of snowmobiles in hunting them, with the last specimen being killed in 166.

 The gray wolf was exterminated in Denmark in 1772 and Norway's last wolf was killed in 173.

 The species was decimated in 2th century Finland, despite regular dispersals from Russia.

 The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1, though its numbers increased after World War II.

In Central Europe, wolves were dramatically reduced in number during the early nineteenth century, because of organized hunts and reductions in ungulate populations.

 In Bavaria, the last wolf was killed in 1847, and had disappeared from the Rhine regions by  In Switzerland, wolves were extinct in the twentieth century; they are naturally coming back from Italy since the 1s.

14 In 134, Nazi Germany became the first state in modern history to place the wolf under protection, though the species was already extirpated in Germany at this point.

15 The last freeliving wolf to be killed on the soil of presentday Germany before 145 was the socalled "Tiger of Sabrodt", which was shot near Hoyerswerda, Lusatia (then Lower Silesia) in 14.

 Today, wolves have returned to the area.

 Wolf hunting in France was first institutionalized by Charlemagne between 8¡V813, when he established the louveterie, a special corps of wolf hunters.

 The louveterie was abolished after the French Revolution in 178, but was reestablished in 1814.

 In 1883, up to 1,386 wolves were killed, with many more by poison.

Last wolf to be killed in central Finland (Karstula, 111)In Eastern Europe, wolves were never fully exterminated, because of the area's contiguity with Asia and its large forested areas.

 However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century.

 Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during the first decade of the twentieth century and, by the midtwentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland.

 Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands.

 Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 2th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin.

 Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,8 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,6 from 155¡V165.

 An alltime low was reached in 167, when the population was reduced to 1,55 animals.

 The extermination of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1, animals in 155 was reduced to about 1¡V2 in 164.

 In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 13.

 Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia.

 Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 123, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia.

 The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.

In Southern Europe, wolf extermination was not as complete as in Northern Europe, because of greater cultural tolerance of the species.

 Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 1thcentury, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1.

 Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 15.

 Wolves were exterminated in the Alps by 18, and numbered only 1 by 173, inhabiting only 3¡V5% of their former Italian range.

RecoveryRange of Canis lupus in Europe, based on Canis lupus European regional assessment, IUCN and Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe.

 Lime color stands for population lower than 8, while green is above 8.

The recovery of European wolf populations began after the 15s, when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed the need to heavily persecute wolves.

 By the 18s, small and isolated wolf populations expanded in the wake of decreased human density in rural areas and the recovery of wild prey populations.

The gray wolf has been fully protected in Italy since 176, and now holds a population of over 1,261,8.

 Italian wolves entered France's Mercantour National Park in 13, and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western Alps in 2.

 By 213 the 25 wolves in the Western Alps imposed a significant burden on traditional sheep and goat husbandry with a loss of over 5, animals in 212.

 There are approximately 2, wolves inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula, of which 15 reside in northeastern Portugal.

 In Spain, the species occurs in Galicia, Leon, and Asturias.

 Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually, the population has expanded south across the river Duero and east to the Asturias and Pyrenees Mountains.

European wolf in Bavarian Forest National Park, GermanyIn 178, wolves began recolonising central Sweden after a twelveyear absence, and have since expanded into southern Norway.

 As of 25, the total number of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred, including eleven breeding pairs.

 The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway.

 The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring Finland's contiguity with the Republic of Karelia, which houses a large population of wolves.

 Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons, though poaching remains common, with % of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two.

 Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply.

 Since 211, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries.

 In 216, a female wolf tracked 55 kilometers from a region southwest of Berlin to settle in Jutland, Denmark where male wolves had been reported in 212 for the first time in 2 years.

15 Wolves have also commenced breeding in Lower Austria's Waldviertel region for the first time in over 13 years.

16Wolf populations in Poland have increased to about 8¡V individuals since being classified as a game species in 176.

 Poland plays a fundamental role in providing routes of expansion into neighbouring Central European countries.

 In the east, its range overlaps with populations in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Slovakia.

 A population in western Poland expanded into eastern Germany and in 2 the first pups were born on German territory.

 In 212, an estimated 14 wolf packs were living in Germany (mostly in the east and north) and a pack with pups has been sighted within 15 miles of Berlin; the number increased to 46 packs in 216.

 The gray wolf is protected in Slovakia, though an exception is made for wolves killing livestock.

 A few Slovakian wolves disperse into the Czech Republic, where they are afforded full protection.

 Wolves in Slovakia, Ukraine and Croatia may disperse into Hungary, where the lack of cover hinders the buildup of an autonomous population.

 Although wolves have special status in Hungary, they may be hunted with a yearround permit if they cause problems.

Romania has a large population of wolves, numbering 2,5 animals.

 The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 16, although the law is not enforced.

 The number of wolves in Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

 Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain.

 Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 186, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia.

AsiaHistorical range and declineMonument to the last Japanese gray wolf, Nara Prefecture, JapanDuring the 1th century, gray wolves were widespread in many parts of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River.

 However, they decreased considerably in number between 164 and 18, largely because of persecution by farmers.

 The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 1th century, with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern Asir, northern rocky areas bordering Jordan, or areas surrounding Riyadh.

The gray wolf's range in the Soviet Union encompassed nearly the entire territory of the country, being absent only on the Solovetsky Islands, FranzJosef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and the Karagin, Commander and Shantar Islands.

 The species was exterminated twice in Crimea, once after the Russian Civil War, and again after World War II.

 Following the two world wars, Soviet wolf populations peaked twice.

 3, wolves were harvested annually out of a population of 2, during the 14s, with 4,¡V5, harvested during peak years.

 Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 17, disappearing over much of European Russia.

 The population increased again by 18 to about 75,, with 32, being killed in 17.

 Wolf populations in northern inner Mongolia declined during the 14s, primarily because of poaching of gazelles, the wolf's main prey.

 In Britishruled India, wolves were heavily persecuted because of their attacks on sheep, goats and children.

 In 1876, 2,825 wolves were bountied in the NorthWestern Provinces (NWP) and Bihar.

 By the 12s, wolf extermination remained a priority in the NWP and Awadh.

 Overall, over 1, wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 116.

Wolves in Japan became extinct during the Meiji restoration period, an extermination known as kami no kujo.

 The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign.

 The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23, 15 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro).

16 The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 2, years ago during the Pleistocene.

 During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaid, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago.

 Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,¡V13, years ago in response to these climatological and ecological pressures.

 Although Turkish wolves have no legal protection, they may number about 7 individuals.

In 28, an authoritative reference stated that the gray wolf could be found across mainland China.

 In 217, a comprehensive study found that the gray wolf was present across all of mainland China, both in the past and today.

 It exists in southern China, which refutes claims made by some researchers in the Western world that the wolf had never existed in southern China.

There is little reliable data on the status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so.

 Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 3¡V6 wolves live undisturbed.

 The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably because of a lack of pastoralism and abundant human waste.

 Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia.

 The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria.

 A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there.

 Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan.

 Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel.

 Elsewhere, it can be hunted yearround by Bedouins.

Little is known of current wolf populations in Iran, which once occurred throughout the country in low densities during the mid17s.

 The northern regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are important strongholds for the wolf.

 It has been estimated that there are about 3 wolves in approximately 6, km2 (23, sq mi) of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India, and 5 more in Himachal Pradesh.

 Overall, India supports about 83, wolves, scattered among several remnant populations.

 Although protected since 172, Indian wolves are classed as endangered, with many populations lingering in low numbers or living in areas increasingly used by humans.

 Although present in Nepal and Bhutan, there is no information of wolves occurring there.

Wolf populations throughout Northern and Central Asia are largely unknown, but are estimated in the hundreds of thousands based on annual harvests.

 Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continentwide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,¡V3, animals throughout the former Soviet Union.

 In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves.

 Mongolian populations have been estimated at 1,¡V3,, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary.

 The north has a declining population of an estimated 4 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 1, and 2, respectively.

North AmericaHistorical range of Subspecies of Canis lupus in North America1 lb (45 kg) gray wolf killed in Montana, 128.

 Before they were extirpated around 13, Montana's wolves could be very large.

 Wolves recolonized the state from Canada beginning in the 17s.

Historical range and declineOriginally, the gray wolf occupied all of North America north of about 2¢XN.

 It occurred all over the mainland, save for the southeastern United States, California west of the Sierra Nevada, and the tropical and subtropical areas of Mexico.

 Large continental islands occupied by wolves included Newfoundland, Vancouver Island, southeastern Alaskan islands, and throughout the Arctic Archipelago and Greenland.

 While Lohr and Ballard postulated that the gray wolf had never been present on Prince Edward Island, analysis of references to the island's native fauna in unpublished and published historical records has found that gray wolves were resident there at the time of the first French settlement in 172.

 In his 6 November 1721 letter to the French Minister of the Marine, Louis Denys de La Ronde reported that the island was home to wolves "of a prodigious size", and sent a wolf pelt back to France to substantiate his claim.

 As the island was cleared for settlement, the gray wolf population may have been extirpated, or relocated to the mainland across the winter ice: the few subsequent wolf reports date from the midnineteenth century and describe the creatures as transient visitors from across the Northumberland Strait.

The decline of North American wolf populations coincided with increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture.

 By the start of the 2th century, the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA, excepting some areas of the Appalachians and the northwestern Great Lakes Region.

 In Canada, the gray wolf was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 187 and 121, and in Newfoundland around 111.

 It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 185 and 1.

 The gray wolf's decline in the prairies began with the extermination of the American bison and other ungulates in the 186s¡V7s.

 From 1¡V13, the gray wolf was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada, because of intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species.

 The gray wolf was exterminated by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 16, except in Alaska and northern Minnesota.

 The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 13s to the early 15s, particularly in southwestern Canada, because of expanding ungulate populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting.

 This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada.

 Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 15s to the early 16s, mostly by poisoning.

 This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid17s.

Modern rangeCaptive Mexican gray wolfThe species' modern range in North America is mostly confined to Alaska and Canada, with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and small portions of Washington, Idaho, northern Oregon, and Montana.

 A functional wolf population should exist in California by 224 according to estimates by state wildlife officials.

17 Canadian wolves began to naturally recolonize northern Montana around Glacier National Park in 17, and the first wolf den in the western U.

S.

 in over half a century was documented there in 186.

18 The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew as a result of natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 14.

 From 15¡V16, wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho.

 In addition, the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 18.

 The gray wolf is found in approximately 8% of its historical range in Canada, thus making it an important stronghold for the species.

Canada is home to about 52,¡V6, wolves, whose legal status varies according to province and territory.

 First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not.

 In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist.

 Largescale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by governmentmandated programs in order to support populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou.

In Alaska, the gray wolf population is estimated at 6,¡V7,, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions.

 As of 22, there are 25 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 26 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho.

 The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 174, and was reclassed from endangered to threatened in 23.

 Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 22, number 28 individuals in eight packs.

 A female wolf shot in 213 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times.

 DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics similar to those of wolves in the Great Lakes Region.

s1.

ogvFootage of a gray wolf taken from Abruzzo Natural Park showing advanced signs of canine distemperViral diseases carried by wolves include rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, papillomatosis, and canine coronavirus.

 Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and India.

 In wolves, the incubation period is 8¡V21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to 8 kilometres (5 mi) a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves.

 Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, with most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals.

 Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska.

 The canine parvovirus, which causes death by dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and endotoxic shock or sepsis, is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups.

 Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it.

 Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely doesn't cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviors.

 The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, with infections being most prevalent in winter months.

Bacterial diseases carried by wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis,18 listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease.

 Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer.

 While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females.

 Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations.

 Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death.

 Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste.

 Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown.

 Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.

18Parasitic infectionsWolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with wolves in the former Soviet Union having been recorded to carry at least 5 species.

 Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.

1 Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans.

 In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.

Wolves are often infested with a variety of arthropod exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites.

 The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite),1 though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes.

 Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death.

 Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

1 The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves.

 Other ectoparasites include biting lice, sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.

Endoparasites known to infect wolves include protozoans and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thornyheaded worms).

 Of 3, protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia.

1 Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3¡V13 times more likely to miscarry than those not infected.

 Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves.

 Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little.

 Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation.

 Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs.

 Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon.

 Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host.

 Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition.

 Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.

 Wolves can carry over 3 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host.

 Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death.

 Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea.

 Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 1 cm.

 D.

 renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected.

 Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy.

 Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates.

 Although T.

 spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs.

1 Thornyheaded worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.

1Relationships with humansIn cultureIn personal namesOld English literature contains several instances of AngloSaxon kings and warriors taking on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their names.

 Examples include Wulfhere, Cynewulf, Ceonwulf, Wulfheard, Earnwulf, Wulfmr, Wulfstn and Athelwulf.

 Wolfrelated names were also common among preChristian Germanic warriors: Wolfhroc (WolfFrock), Wolfhetan (Wolf Hide), Isangrim (Grey Mask), Scrutolf (Garb Wolf), Wolfgang (Wolf Gait) and Wolfdregil (Wolf Runner).

Ancient Greek literature is similar: Autolycus ("the wolf itself"), Lycurgus ("wolfwork").

The Latin for "female prostitute" is lupa, and the most famous brothel in Pompeii was the Lupanar.

In folklore, religion and mythologyMain article: Wolves in folklore, religion and mythologyThe wolf is a common motif in the foundational mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout Eurasia and North America (corresponding to the historical extent of the habitat of the gray wolf).

 The obvious attribute of the wolf is its nature of a predator, and correspondingly it is strongly associated with danger and destruction, making it the symbol of the warrior on one hand, and that of the devil on the other.

 The modern trope of the Big Bad Wolf is a development of this.

 The wolf holds great importance in the cultures and religions of the nomadic peoples, both of the Eurasian steppe and of the North American Plains.

 In many cultures, the identification of the warrior with the wolf (totemism) gave rise to the notion of Lycanthropy, the mythical or ritual identification of man and wolf.

In fable and literatureLittle Red Riding Hood (1883), Gustave DoreAesop featured wolves in several of his fables, playing on the concerns of Ancient Greece's settled, sheepherding world.

 His most famous is the fable of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, which is directed at those who knowingly raise false alarms, and from which the idiomatic phrase "to cry wolf" is derived.

 Some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves, as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs.

 Although Aesop used wolves to warn, criticize and moralize about human behavior, his portrayals added to the wolf's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal.

 Isengrim the wolf, a character first appearing in the 12thcentury Latin poem Ysengrimus, is a major character in the Reynard Cycle, where he stands for the low nobility, whilst his adversary, Reynard the fox, represents the peasant hero.

 Although portrayed as loyal, honest and moral, Isengrim is forever the victim of Reynard's wit and cruelty, often dying at the end of each story.

 The tale of Little Red Riding Hood, first written in 167 by Charles Perrault, is largely considered to have had more influence than any other source of literature in forging the wolf's negative reputation in the western world.

 The wolf in this story is portrayed as a potential rapist, capable of imitating human speech.

 The hunting of wolves, and their attacks on humans and livestock feature prominently in Russian literature, and are included in the works of Tolstoy, Chekhov, Nekrasov, Bunin, Sabaneyev, and others.

 Tolstoy's War and Peace and Chekhov's Peasants both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and borzois.

 Farley Mowat's largely fictional 163 memoir Never Cry Wolf was the first positive portrayal of wolves in popular literature, and is largely considered to be the most popular book on wolves, having been adapted into a Hollywood film and taught in several schools decades after its publication.

 Although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving, cooperative and noble, it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies.

12In heraldry and symbolismMain article: Wolves in heraldryCoat of arms of the Elvange family, featuring a wolf charge rampantThe wolf is a frequent charge in English armory.

 It is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of Lord Welby, Rendel, and Viscount Wolseley, and can be found on the coat of arms of Lovett and the vast majority of the Wilsons and Lows.

 The demiwolf is a common crest, appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demiwolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to Charles II during the battle of Worcester.

 Wolf heads are common in Scottish heraldry, particularly in the coats of Clan Robertson and Skene.

 The wolf is the most common animal in Spanish heraldry, and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back.

 The wolf is featured on the flags of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Pawnee.

 In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups.

 It is the unofficial symbol of the spetsnaz, and serves as the logo of the Turkish Grey Wolves.

 During the Yugoslav Wars, several Serb paramilitary units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the Wolves of Vujak.

ConflictsWaiting for a Chinook (c.

 1), Charles Marion RussellWolf predation on livestockLivestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.

 Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance.

 Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.

 Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.

 The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.

 The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America).

 The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.

 Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.

8 In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.

Conflicts with dogsBeing the most abundant carnivores, feral and freeranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves.

 A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.

221 Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.

Wolves kill dogs on occasion, with some wolf populations relying on dogs as an important food source.

 In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations.

 Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans.

 Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests.

 Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.

 The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers, with older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently.

 Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.

Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs.

 In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members.

 The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.

21Dogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human¡Vwolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the nonlethal tools in the conservation of wolves.

 Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression.

 The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestockguarding dogs.

 However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.

Wolf predation on humansMain articles: Wolf attacks on humans and List of wolf attacksChild snatched by a wolf (114), Le Petit JournalThe fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies, though humans are not part of the wolf's natural prey.

 How wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people: wolves lacking any negative experience of humans, or which are foodconditioned, may show little fear of people.

 Although wolves may react aggressively under provocation, such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed.

 Predatory attacks (attacks by wolves treating humans as food) may be preceded by a long period of habituation, in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans.

 The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off.

 Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated.

 Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June¡VAugust period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock grazing or berry and mushroom picking) increase, though cases of nonrabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in Belarus, Kirov and Irkutsk oblasts, Karelia and Ukraine.

 Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.

 The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.

 Cases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes.

 Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and Central Asia.

 Wolves apparently develop the "furious" phase of rabies to a very high degree which, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals, with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.

 Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals.

 Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods.

 Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day.

 Also, the victims are chosen at random, though the majority of cases involve adult men.

 In the halfcentury up to 22, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, and more than 2 in south Asia.

 Between 25¡V21, two people were killed in North America.

21Human predation on wolvesMain articles: Wolf hunting and Wolf hunting with dogsCarcasses of hunted wolves in Russia.

Wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs.

22 Historic methods include killing of springborn litters in their dens, coursing with dogs (usually combinations of sighthounds, bloodhounds and fox terriers), poisoning with strychnine, and trapping.

 A popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with fladry poles carrying a human scent.

 This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the smell.

 Some hunters are able to lure wolves by imitating their calls.

 In Kazakhstan and Mongolia, wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practise is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number.

 Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire, but is controversial.

 Several types of dog, including like the Borzoi, Irish wolfhound, and Kyrgyz Tajgan, have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.

21See also: Human uses of hunted wolvesAs pets and working animalsMain article: Wolves as pets and working animalsGray wolves and coyotes used as draught animals in northern Ontario, 123Wild wolves are sometimes kept as exotic pets and, in some rarer occasions, as working animals.

 Although closely related to domesticated dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, and generally, much more work is required in order to obtain the same amount of reliability.

 Wolves also need much more space than dogs, about 26¡V3 square kilometres (1¡V15 sq mi), so they can exercise.

The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal.

 They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.

 They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.

 There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.

Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.

 Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche.

 Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.

 They can see in near darkness.

 Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.

 Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of catspecific body language.

Cats have a high breeding rate.

 Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy.

 Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, as well as the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.

 In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many bird species.

 Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed to the extinction of isolated island populations.

1 Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and freeranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.

Since cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around ,5 years ago (7,5 BC).

 A genetic study in  concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8, BC in the Middle East.

 A 216 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,5 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today.

 A 217 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around , years ago.

1As of a 27 study, cats are the second most popular pet in the US by number of pets owned, behind freshwater fish.

2 In a 21 study they were ranked the third most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs, with around 8 million being owned.

Taxonomy and evolutionMain article: Cat evolutionThe domestic cat is believed to have evolved from the Near Eastern wildcat, whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa.

 Between 7, and 1, years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat around 8, BC in the Middle East.

The felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that share a common ancestor only 1¡V15 million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others.

 Within this family, domestic cats (Felis catus) are part of the genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme).

 Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F.

 silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F.

 s.

 lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F.

 bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F.

 margarita), among others.

The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 1th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758.

 Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F.

 silvestris.

2 This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus.

2 Wildcats have also been referred to as various subspecies of F.

 catus,2 but in 23, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F.

 silvestris.

3 The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F.

 catus.

 Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.

C.

P.

 Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature.

 A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin 14) but now this population is considered to be a part of domestic cat.

All the cats in this genus share a common ancestor that is believed to have lived around 6¡V7 million years ago in the Near East (the Middle East).

 The exact relationships within the Felidae are close but still uncertain, e.

 The earliest evidence of felines as Egyptian deities comes from c.

In comparison to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as the form and behavior of the domestic cat is not radically different from those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild.

3 Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F.

 catus populations,4 producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat.

 This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat.

 Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets.

3 These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence.

¡V17 Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.

3Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans.

 Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated.

 In one, people deliberately tamed cats in a process of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin.

 This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests.

 The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.

Nomenclature and etymologyThe origin of the English word cat (Old English catt) and its counterparts in other Germanic languages (such as German Katze), descended from ProtoGermanic *kattn, is controversial.

 It has traditionally thought to be a borrowing from Late Latin cattus "domestic cat", from catta (used around 75 AD by Martial), compare also Byzantine Greek , Portuguese and Spanish gato, French chat, Maltese qattus, Lithuanian kat, and Old Church Slavonic kot (kotka), among others.

 The Late Latin word is generally thought to originate from an AfroAsiatic language, but every proposed source word has presented problems.

 Many references refer to "Berber" (Kabyle) kaddiska "wildcat" and "Nubian kads" as possible sources or cognates, but M.

 Lionel Bender says the Nubian term is a loan from Arabic  qia.

 JeanPaul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic  (au) "tomcat" or its feminine form suffixed with t, but John Huehnergard says "the source .

.

.

 was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested.

" Huehnergard opines it is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".

 Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf.

 Northern Sami gafe "female stoat" and Hungarian holgy "stoat; lady, bride" from ProtoUralic *kawa "female (of a fur animal)".

4 In any case, cat is a classic case of a Wanderwort.

An alternative word is English puss (extended as pussy and pussycat).

 Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt.

 Similar forms exist in Lithuanian pui and Irish puisin or puiscin.

 The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.

A group of cats is referred to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten.

 The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam.

 In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.

A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization.

 A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed.

 Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats.

 Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as domestic shorthaired or domestic longhaired cats, by coat type, or commonly as randombred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or muttcats.

While the African wildcat is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other.

 The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households.

 Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.

4BiologyAnatomyMain article: Cat anatomyDiagram of the general anatomy of a maleDomestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis, typically weighing between 4 and 5 kg ( and 1 lb).

 Some breeds, such as the Maine Coon, can occasionally exceed 11 kg (24 lb).

 Conversely, very small cats, less than 2 kg (4 lb), have been reported.

5 The world record for the largest cat is 21 kg (5 lb).

6 The smallest adult cat ever officially recorded weighed around 1 kg (2 lb).

6 Feral cats tend to be lighter as they have more limited access to food than house cats.

 In the Boston area, the average feral adult male will weigh 4 kg ( lb) and average feral female 3 kg (7 lb).

 Cats average about 23¡V25 cm (¡V1 in) in height and 46 cm (18 in) in head/body length (males being larger than females), with tails averaging 3 cm (12 in) in length.

Cats have seven cervical vertebrae, as do almost all mammals; 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae like most mammals (humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans retain three to five caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).

 The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility.

 Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.

  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by freefloating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.

Cat skullThe cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw.

 Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat.

 When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.

 Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.

 The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors.

 These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.

 Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.

Cats, like dogs, are digitigrades.

 They walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.

 Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all felines, they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks.

 This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain.

 Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" gait; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side.

 This trait is shared with camels and giraffes.

 As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as lizards): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.

6Like almost all members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and retractable claws.

7 In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads.

 This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey.

 The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.

 Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws.

 They may extend their claws in hunting or selfdefense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces.

 Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws.

 The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws.

 More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger".

 This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs.

 It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping.

 Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and claws).

 These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.

PhysiologyCats are familiar and easily kept animals, and their physiology has been particularly well studied; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals, but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desertdwelling species.

 For instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: Humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about 38 ¢XC (1 ¢XF), but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around 52 ¢XC (126 ¢XF), and can tolerate temperatures of up to 56 ¢XC (133 ¢XF) if they have access to water.

Normal physiological valuesBody temperature	38.

6 ¢XC (11.

5 ¢XF)Heart rate	12¡V14 beats per minuteBreathing rate	16¡V4 breaths per minuteThermograph of various body parts of a catCats conserve heat by reducing the flow of blood to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths.

 Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed).

 A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night.

 Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible.

 Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water,7 and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater.

While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.

NutritionCats are obligate carnivores: their physiology has evolved to efficiently process meat, and they have difficulty digesting plant matter.

 In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 2% of a cat's diet must be protein.

 A cat's gastrointestinal tract is adapted to meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels of several of the digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates.

 These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plantderived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids.

 Despite the cat's meatoriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet.

 However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies.

 However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.

Cats do eat grass occasionally.

 A proposed explanation is that cats use grass as a source of folic acid.

 Another is that it is used to supply dietary fiber, helping the cat defecate more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and vomit.

Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal.

 Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes aminotransferase and pyrroline5carboxylate which are responsible for the synthesis of ornithine and citrulline in the small intestine.

 Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine.

 Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine.

 Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a build up of toxic ammonia and leads to hyperammonemia.

 The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, hyperesthesia and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed a arginine free diet.

 The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.

Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with a deficiency in this essential amino acid causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly breaks down, causing irreversible blindness.

 This is due to the hepatic activity of cystinesulfinic acid decarboxylase being low in cats.

8 This limits the ability of cats to biosynthesize the taurine they need from its precursor amino acids ethionine and cysteine, which ultimately results in inadequate taurine production needed for normal function.

8 Deficiencies in taurine result in compensated function of feline cardiovascular and reproductive systems.

8 These abnormalities can also be accompanied by developmental issues in the central nervous system along with degeneration of the retina.

8In order to produce the essential vitamin niacin for use in the cat, tryptophan is needed for conversion purposes.

 However, due to a competing pathway with acetyl coenzyme A (acetylCoA), niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.

 This process occurs when an overactive enzyme, picolinic acid carboxylase, converts the vitamin B6 precursor picolinic acid into the alternate compound acetylCoA, instead of converting quinolinate into nictotinic acid mononlucleotide (niacin).

 Niacin is required in cats as it supports enzyme function.

 If niacin is deficient in the diet, anorexia, weight loss and an increase in body temperature can result.

Preformed vitamin A is required in the cat for retinal and reproductive health.

 Vitamin A is considered to be a fatsoluble vitamin and is seen as essential in a cat's diet.

 Normally, the conversion of betacarotenes into vitamin A occurs in the intestine (more specifically the mucosal layer) of species, however cats lack the ability to undergo this process.

 Both the kidney and liver are contributors to the use of vitamin A in the body of the majority of species while the cats liver does not produce the enzyme Betacarotene 15,15'monooxygenase which converts the betacarotene into retinol (vitamin A).

 To summarize: cats do not have high levels of this enzyme leading to the cleavage and oxidation of carotenoids not taking place.

Vitamin D3 is a dietary requirement for cats as they lack the ability to synthesize vitamin D3 from sunlight.

 Cats obtain high levels of the enzyme 7dehydrocholestrol delta 7 reductase which causes immediate conversion of vitamin D3 from sunlight to 7dehydrocholesterol.

 This fat soluble vitamin is required in cats for bone formation through the promotion of calcium retention, along with nerve and muscle control through absorption of calcium and phosphorus.

Cats, like all mammals, need to get linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid, from their diet.

 Most mammals can convert linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, as well as the omega 3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) through the activity of enzymes, but this process is very limited in cats.

 The £G6desaturase enzyme eventually converts linoleic acid, which is in its salt form linoleate, to arachidonate (salt form of arachidonic acid) in the liver, but this enzyme has very little activity in cats.

 This means that arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid for cats as they lack the ability to create required amounts of linoleic acid.

 Deficiency of arachidonic acid in cats is related to problems in growth, can cause injury and inflammation to skin (e.

g.

 around the mouth) decreased platelet aggregation, fatty liver, increase in birth defects of kittens whose queens were deficient during pregnancy, and reproductive failure in queens.

 Arachidonic acid can also be metabolized to eicosanoids that create inflammatory responses which are needed to stimulate proper growth and repair mechanisms in the cat.

The nutrient chart provides a list of the many nutrients cats require as well as the use of the nutrients in the body and the effects of the deficiency.

SensesMain article: Cat sensesReflection of camera flash from the tapetum lucidumCats have excellent night vision and can see at only onesixth the light level required for human vision.

 This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.

 Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes.

 Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils.

 These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats.

 At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.

 However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green.

1 A 13 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which might be due to a third type of cone.

 However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.

Cats have excellent hearing and can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies.

 They can hear higherpitched sounds than either dogs or humans, detecting frequencies from 55 Hz to 7, Hz, a range of 1.

5 octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about  octaves.

 Cats can hear ultrasound, which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls.

 However, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do.

 Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute in the range of 5 Hz to 32 kHz.

 This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise.

Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their welldeveloped olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.

8 cm2 (.

 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans.

 Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3mercapto3methylbutan1ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands.

1 Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion.

11 About 7¡V8% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.

 This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.

Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (47 or so versus more than , on the human tongue).

 Domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.

 Their taste buds instead respond to amino acids, bitter tastes, and acids.

 Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ located in their mouths that allows them to tastesmell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience.

 Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 ¢XC (1 ¢XF) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the "prey" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).

The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces.

 These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching.

 In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a leopard.

 Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory.

 During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility.

 This is known as the cat righting reflex.

 An individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so, during a fall.

 The height required for this to occur is around  cm (3.

 ft).

 Cats without a tail (e.

g.

 Manx cats) also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.

HealthMain articles: Cat health and Aging in catsThe average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent years.

 In the early 18s, it was about seven years,11 rising to .

4 years in 1511 and 12¡V15 years in 214.

unreliable source However, cats have been reported as surviving into their 3s, with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38.

Spaying or neutering increases life expectancy: one study found neutered male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.

11 Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.

Despite widespread concern about the welfare of freeroaming cats, the lifespans of neutered feral cats in managed colonies compare favorably with those of pet cats.

: 1213DiseasesMain article: Feline diseasesA wide range of health problems may affect cats, including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries, and chronic disease.

 Vaccinations are available for many of these diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.

PoisoningIn addition to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at some forms of detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs.

 Some of the most common causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits.

 Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants.

 When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it has possibly been exposed to a toxin.

Many human medicines should never be given to cats.

 For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal.

 Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously.

 Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by wellmeaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal.

 Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.

13Other common household substances that should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products.

 Phenolbased products (e.

g.

 PineSol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal.

14 Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and as little as a teaspoonful can be fatal.

 Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate.

 Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats.

 Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and lifethreatening kidney damage.

GeneticsMain article: Cat geneticsThe domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 2, genes.

 About 25 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn errors.

 The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases.

14BehaviorSee also: Cat behavior and Cat intelligenceA blackandwhite cat on a fenceA cat on a fence.

Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.

 The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied, which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times.

 Although they spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their home, housecats can range many hundreds of meters from this central point, and are known to establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17¡V6 acres).

Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older.

 The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average.

 Some cats can sleep as much as 2 hours.

 The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period.

 While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.

SociabilitySocial groomingAlthough wildcats are solitary, the social behavior of domestic cats is much more variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of cooperating females.

 Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others.

 Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 1 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories.

1 These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation.

1 Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts.

 Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks.

 Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, they do not have a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.

Cat with an Alaskan Malamute dogHowever, some pet cats are poorly socialized.

 In particular, older cats may show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.

Though cats and dogs are often characterized as natural enemies, they can live together if correctly socialized.

Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals.

 Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother,15 and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood,16 a form of behavioral neoteny.

 The highpitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.

CommunicationMain article: Cat communicationDomestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.

 (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.

) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood.

 The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility.

 Tailraising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals.

 Nosetonose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.

Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens.

 Postnursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating.

 The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive.

 The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound.

 It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr.

 However, felids of the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling.

GroomingThe hooked papillae on a cat's tongue act like a hairbrush to help clean and detangle fur.

File:Housecat Grooming Itself.

webmA tabby housecat uses its brushlike tongue to groom itself, licking its fur to straighten it.

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coat to keep it clean.

16 The cat's tongue has backwardsfacing spines about 5 £gm long, which are called papillae.

 These contain keratin which makes them rigid17 so the papillae act like a hairbrush.

 Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming.

 These clumps of fur are usually sausageshaped and about 2¡V3 cm (.

8¡V1.

2 in) long.

 Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.

16FightingAmong domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.

 Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female.

 In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male.

 Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home.

 Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens.

 Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.

An arched back, raised fur, and an openmouthed hiss can all be signs of aggression in a domestic cat.

When cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.

 Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward.

 They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent.

 Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites.

 Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears.

 However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations.

 Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated.

 In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus.

 Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.

Hunting and feedingA cat that is playing with a caught mouse.

 Cats play with their prey to weaken or exhaust them before making a kill.

Cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents, and are often used as a form of pest control.

17 Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.

4¡V3.

7 billion birds and 6.

¡V2.

7 billion mammals annually.

 The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 8 million feral and stray cats.

 Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts.

 In the case of freeranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation.

Freefed feral cats and house cats tend to consume many small meals in a single day, although the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals.

 Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured.

 Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to "play" with prey by releasing it after capture.

 This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.

 This behavior is referred to in the idiom "catandmouse game" or simply "cat and mouse".

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians.

 Ethologist Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.

 Anthropologist and zoologist Desmond Morris, in his 186 book Catwatching, suggests, when cats bring home mice or birds, they are attempting to teach their human to hunt, or trying to help their human as if feeding "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten".

 Morris's hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, despite males having negligible involvement with raising kittens.

Domestic cats select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat.

 Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past.

 They may also avoid sugary foods and milk.

 Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea.

 They can also develop odd eating habits.

 Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal.

 This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.

181Though cats usually prey on animals less than half their size, a feral cat in Australia has been photographed killing an adult pademelon of around the cat's weight at 4 kg (8.

8 lb).

Since cats lack lips to create suction, they use a lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths.

 Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.

PlayMain article: Cat play and toysFile:Play fight between cats.

webmhd.

webmPlay fight between kittens, age 14 weeksDomestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play.

 This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey.

 Cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans.

 This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.

Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before.

 Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry.

 String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death.

 Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.

1ReproductionSee also: KittenWhen cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to mating known as lordosis behavior.

Radiography of a pregnant cat (about one month and a half)Female cats are seasonally polyestrous, which means they may have many periods of heat over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn.

 Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.

2 Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat.

 The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate.

 At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate.

 The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 12¡V15 backwardspointing penile spines, which are about 1 mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation.

 This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.

After mating, the female washes her vulva thoroughly.

 If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him.

 After about 2 to 3 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.

2Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.

 Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.

2A newborn kittenAt 124 hours after conception, the morula forms.

 At 148 hours, early blastocysts form.

 At 1¡V12 days, implantation occurs.

The gestation period for cats is between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 66 days.

 The size of a litter usually is three to five kittens, with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters.

 Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks old, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5¡V1 months (females) and to 5¡V7 months (males), although this can vary depending on breed.

2 Females can have two to three litters per year, so may produce up to 15 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years.

2Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother.

 They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit unwanted reproduction.

 This surgery also prevents undesirable sexrelated behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females.

 Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months.

 In the US, about 8% of household cats are neutered.

2EcologyHabitatsA cat in snowy weatherCats are a cosmopolitan species and are found across much of the world.

 Geneticist Stephen James O'Brien, of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland, remarked on how successful cats have been in evolutionary terms: "Cats are one of evolution's most charismatic creatures.

 They can live on the highest mountains and in the hottest deserts.

"21 They are extremely adaptable and are now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands¡Xeven on isolated islands such as the Kerguelen Islands.

Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.

 Their habitats even include small oceanic islands with no human inhabitants.

 Further, the close relatives of domestic cats, the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and the Arabian sand cat (Felis margarita) both inhabit desert environments, and domestic cats still show similar adaptations and behaviors.

 The cat's ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat has led to its designation as one of the world's worst invasive species.

As domestic cats are little altered from wildcats, they can readily interbreed.

 This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.

Feral catsMain article: Feral catFeral farm catFeral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state.

 They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.

 The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 6 million.

 Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.

 Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.

Public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as freeranging pets, to regarding them as vermin.

 One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trapneuterreturn', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against diseases such as rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released.

21 Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again.

 Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives.

 Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.

Impact on prey speciesCarrying half of a rabbitTo date, little scientific data is available to assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations outside of agricultural situations.

 Even wellfed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates.

22 Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to the decline in the numbers of birds in urban areas, although the importance of this effect remains controversial.

 In the wild, the introduction of feral cats during human settlement can threaten native species with extinction.

 In many cases, controlling or eliminating the populations of nonnative cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals.

 However, the ecological role of introduced cats can be more complicated.

 For example, cats can control the numbers of rats, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing mesopredators.

In isolated landmasses, such as Australasia, there are often no other native, mediumsized quadrupedal predators (including other feline species); this tends to exacerbate the impact of feral cats on small native animals.

 Native species such as the New Zealand kakapo and the Australian bettong, for example, tend to be more ecologically vulnerable and behaviorally "naive", when faced with predation by cats.

 Feral cats have had a major impact on these native species and have played a leading role in the endangerment and extinction of many animals.

Even in places with ancient and numerous cat populations, such as Western Europe, cats appear to be growing in number and independently of their environments' carrying capacity (such as the numbers of prey available).

 This may be explained, at least in part, by an abundance of food, from sources including feeding by pet owners and scavenging.

 For instance, research in Britain suggests that a high proportion of cats hunt only "recreationally".

 And in South Sweden, where research in 182 found that the population density of cats was as high as 2, per square kilometre (5,2/sq mi).

In agricultural settings, cats can be effective at keeping mouse and rat populations low, but only if rodent harborage locations are kept under control.

2223 While cats are effective at preventing rodent population explosions, they are not effective for eliminating preexisiting severe infestations.

Impact on birdsA black cat eating a house sparrowThe domestic cat is a significant predator of birds.

 UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.

8 million bird deaths each year.

 A 212 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds each year in the United States.

 Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 3% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat.

 In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation.

 In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety.

 The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.

On islands, birds can contribute as much as 6% of a cat's diet.

 In nearly all cases, however, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a 'mesopredator release' effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey.

 Domestic cats are, however, known to be a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction.

 The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, the New Zealand merganser, and the common diving petrel23 are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery.

Some of the same factors that have promoted adaptive radiation of island avifauna over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to nonnative species in modern time.

 The susceptibility of many island birds is undoubtedly due to evolution in the absence of mainland predators, competitors, diseases, and parasites, in addition to lower reproductive rates and extended incubation periods.

 The loss of flight, or reduced flying ability is also characteristic of many island endemics.

 These biological aspects have increased vulnerability to extinction in the presence of introduced species, such as the domestic cat.

 Equally, behavioral traits exhibited by island species, such as "predatory naivety" and groundnesting, have also contributed to their susceptibility.

Interaction with humansMain article: Human interaction with catsCats and peopleCats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population exceeds 5 million.

 Although cat guardianship has commonly been associated with women, a 27 Gallup poll reported that men and women in the United States of America were equally likely to own a cat.

As well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys;24 and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively25 (about 24 cats are needed to make a cat fur coat).

 This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union.

 Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism.

 In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment.

A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies's one) and over the net, but such a task does not seem simple to achieve.

 General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 2 million to 6 million.

Cat showMain article: Cat showA cat show is a judged event where the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard.

 Both pedigreed and companion (or moggy) cats are admissible, although the rules differ from organization to organization.

 Cats are compared to a breed standard, and the owners of those judged to be closest to it are awarded a prize.

 Moggy's are judged based on their temperament.

 Often, at the end of the year, all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded.

Cat cafeMain article: Cat cafeA cat cafe is a theme cafe whose attraction is cats that can be watched and played with.

 Patrons pay a cover fee, generally hourly and thus cat cafes can be seen as a form of supervised indoor pet rental.

AilurophobiaMain article: AilurophobiaAilurophobia is a human phobia of cats; however, the term is often associated with humans that have a hatred of cats.

Cat bites and scratchesMain article: Cat biteCats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive.

 Complications from cat bites can develop.

 A cat bite differs from the bites of other pets.

 This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures.

 Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps microorganisms that cause infection.

Infections transmitted from cats to humansMain article: Feline zoonosisCats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.

 In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease, However, the same disease can then become evident in a human.

 The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person.

 Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body.

26 Some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat scratch disease and toxoplasmosis.

History and mythologyMain articles: Cultural depictions of cats and Cats in ancient EgyptThe ancient Egyptians mummified dead cats out of respect in the same way that they mummified people.

27Ancient Roman mosaic of a cat killing a partridge from the House of the Faun in PompeiiA 1th century drawing of a tabby catTraditionally, historians tended to think ancient Egypt was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,6 years old.

 However, in 24, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat.

 The grave is estimated to be ,5 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline¡Vhuman association significantly.

 The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than presentday domestic cats.

 This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent around the time of the development of agriculture, and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.

1Direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5,3 years ago in Quanhucun, China has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the University of Washington and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

 The cats are believed to have been attracted to the village by rodents, which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans.

In ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, with the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the warlike aspect of a lioness.

 Killing a cat was absolutely forbidden27 and the Greek historian Herodotus reports that, whenever a household cat died, the entire family would mourn and shave their eyebrows.

27 Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis,27 where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories.

27Domestic cats were probably first introduced to Greece and southern Italy in the fifth century BC by the Phoenicians.

 The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from Magna Graecia dating to the midfifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of Rhegion and Taras respectively, playing with their pet cats.

:Housecats seem to have been extremely rare among the ancient Greeks and Romans; Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.

 Even during later times, weasels were far more commonly kept as pets and weasels, not cats, were seen as the ideal rodentkillers.

 The usual ancient Greek word for "cat" was ailouros, meaning "thing with the waving tail", but this word could also be applied to any of the "various longtailed carnivores kept for catching mice".

 Cats are rarely mentioned in ancient Greek literature, but Aristotle does remark in his History of Animals that "female cats are naturally lecherous.

":The Greeks later syncretized their own goddess Artemis with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis.

 In Ovid's Metamorphoses, when the gods flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess Diana (the Roman equivalent of Artemis) turns into a cat.

 Cats eventually displaced ferrets as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice.

During the Middle Ages, many of Artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the Virgin Mary.

 Cats are often shown in icons of Annunciation and of the Holy Family and, according to Italian folklore, on the same night that Mary gave birth to Jesus, a virgin cat in Bethlehem gave birth to a kitten.

 Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery, as ships' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as goodluck charms.

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are allknowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans.

 In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune.

27Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims.

 Some Western writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza.

28 He is reported to have loved cats so much, "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it".

 The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint, Ahmed arRifa'i, centuries after Muhammad.

Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility in Norse mythology, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.

Superstitions and cat burningMany cultures have negative superstitions about cats.

 An example would be the belief that a black cat "crossing one's path" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills.

 The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous presentday Kattenstoet (cat parade).

In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment.

 According to Norman Davies, the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized".

"It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned.

 The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck.

 The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands.

 In 1648 Louis XIV, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall.

 But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris.

 At Metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people.

 Similarly at Gap, in the department of the HautesAlpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.

"According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives.

 In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanishspeaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.

 The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape lifethreatening situations.

 Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around.

 Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.

 Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large dewlap, and sometimes drooping ears.

 They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the tropical countries, both as pure zebu and as hybrids with taurine cattle, the other main type of domestic cattle.

 Zebu are used as draught oxen, dairy cattle, and beef cattle, as well as for byproducts such as hides and dung for fuel and manure.

 In 1999, researchers at Texas A&M University successfully cloned a zebu.

Taxonomy and nameedit
The scientific name of zebu cattle was originally Bos indicus, but they are now more commonly classified within the species Bos taurus as B.

 t.

 indicus, together with taurine cattle (B.

 t.

 taurus) and the extinct ancestor of both of them, the aurochs (B.

 t.

 primigenius).

2 Taurine ("European") cattle are descended from the Eurasian aurochs, while zebu are descended from the Indian aurochs.

 "Zebu" may be either singular or plural, but "zebus" is also an acceptable plural form.

 The Spanish name, cebuor cebu, is also present in a few English works.


Originedit

3 Wild Asian aurochs disappeared during the time of the Indus Valley Civilisation from its range in the Indus River basin and other parts of South Asia possibly due to interbreeding with domestic zebu and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.

4
Archaeological evidence including pictures on pottery and rocks suggests that the species were present in Egypt around 2000 BC and were thought to be imported from the near east or south.

 Bos indicus is believed to have first appeared in sub-Saharan Africa between 700 and 1500 and was introduced to the Horn of Africa around 1000.

Breeds and hybridsedit

Hariana breed of Zebu cattle in north India
Some 75 breeds of zebu are known, split about evenly between African breeds and South Asian ones.

 The major zebu cattle breeds of the world include Gyr, Kankrej and Guzerat, Indo-Brazilian, Brahman, Nelore, Ongole, Sahiwal, Red Sindhi, Butana and Kenana, Boran, Baggara, Tharparkar, Kangayam, Southern Yellow, Kedah-Kelantan, and Local Indian Dairy (LID).

 Kedah-Kelantan and LID originated from Malaysia.

 Other breeds of zebu are quite local, like the Hariana of Haryana and eastern Punjab6 or the Rath of Alwarin eastern Rajasthan.

7
The African sanga cattle breeds originated from hybridization of zebu with indigenous African humpless cattle; they include the Afrikaner, Red Fulani, Ankole-Watusi, and many other breeds of central and southern Africa.

 Sanga cattle can be distinguished from pure zebu by having smaller humps located farther forward on the animals.



Zebu market in Madagascar
Zebu were imported to Africa over many hundreds of years, and interbred with taurine cattle there.

 Genetic analysis of African cattle has found higher concentrations of zebu genes all along the east coast of Africa, with especially pure cattle on the island of Madagascar, either implying that the method of dispersal was cattle transported by ship or alternatively, the zebu may have reached East Africa via the coastal route (Pakistan, Iran, Southern Arabian coast) much earlier and crossed over to Madagascar.

 Partial resistance to rinderpest led to another increase in the frequency of zebu in Africa.


Zebu, which can tolerate extreme heat,8 were imported into Brazil in the early 20th century and crossbred with Charolais cattle, a European taurine breed.

 The resulting breed, 63% Charolais and 37% zebu, is called the Canchim.

 It has a better meat quality than the zebu and better heat resistance than European cattle.

 The zebu breeds used were primarily Indo-Brazilian with some Nelore and Guzerat.


Many breeds are complex mixtures of the zebu and various taurine types, and some also have yak, gaur, or bantenggenes.

citation needed While zebu are the common cattle in much of Asia, the cattle of Japan, Korea, and Mongolia are taurine (although possibly domesticated separately from the other taurine cattle originating from Europe and Africa).

 Other species of cattle domesticated in parts of Asia include yak, gaur, banteng, and water buffalo.


Hanwoo is a traditional Korean taurine¡Vzebu hybrid breed.


Cattle¡Xcolloquially cowsnote 1¡Xare the most common type of large domesticated ungulates.

 They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus.


Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal), as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products, and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks that pull carts, plows and other implements).

 Other products include leather and dung for manure or fuel.

 In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious meaning.


Around 10,500 years ago, cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in southeast Turkey.

1 According to an estimate from 2011, there are 1.

4 billion cattle in the world.

2 In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome.

3 Some consider cattle the oldest form of wealth, and cattle raiding consequently one of the earliest forms of theft.

A Holstein Fresian cow, a typical member of the Bos taurus taurus sub-species

.
ubro.
, a wisent and cattle hybrid
Cattle were originally identified as three separate species: Bos taurus, the European or "taurine" cattle (including similar types from Africa and Asia); Bos indicus, the zebu; and the extinct Bos primigenius, the aurochs.

 The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle.

4 These have been reclassified as one species, Bos taurus, with three subspecies: Bos taurus primigenius, Bos taurus indicus, and Bos taurus taurus.

56
Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species.

 Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus Bos ¡V yaks (the dzo or yattle7), banteng, and gaur.

 Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well.

8 The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious ¡V for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak.

9 However, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.


The aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia.

 In historical times, its range became restricted to Europe, and the last known individual died in Mazovia, Poland, in about 1627.

10 Breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing traditional types of domesticated cattle, creating the Heck cattlebreed.


Etymology
Cattle did not originate as the term for bovine animals.

 It was borrowed from Anglo-Norman catel, itself from medieval Latin capitale 'principal sum of money, capital', itself derived in turn from Latin caput 'head'.

 Cattle originally meant movable personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens ¡X they were sold as part of the land).

11 The word is a variant of chattel (a unit of personal property) and closely related to capital in the economic sense.

12 The term replaced earlier Old English feoh 'cattle, property', which survives today as fee (cf.

 German: Vieh, Dutch: vee, Gothic: faihu).


The word "cow" came via Anglo-Saxon c.
 (plural c.
), from Common Indo-European gus (genitive g.
owes) = "a bovine animal", compare Persian: gav, Sanskrit: go-, Welsh: buwch.

13 The plural c.
 became ki or kie in Middle English, and an additional plural ending was often added, giving kine, kien, but also kies, kuin and others.

 This is the origin of the now archaic English plural, "kine".

 The Scots language singular is coo or cou, and the plural is "kye".


In older English sources such as the King James Version of the Bible, "cattle" refers to livestock, as opposed to "deer" which refers to wildlife.

 "Wild cattle" may refer to feral cattle or to undomesticated species of the genus Bos.

 Today, when used without any other qualifier, the modern meaning of "cattle" is usually restricted to domesticated bovines.

Terminology
	Look up cattle or cow in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.



An Ongole bull

A Hereford bull
In general, the same words are used in different parts of the world, but with minor differences in the definitions.

 The terminology described here contrasts the differences in definition between the United Kingdom and other British-influenced parts of the world such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United States.

15
	An "intact" (i.

	e.

	, not castrated) adult male is called a bull.

	 A wild, young, unmarked bull is known as a micky in Australia.

	16An unbranded bovine of either sex is called a maverick in the US and Canada.

	
	An adult female that has had a calf (or two, depending on regional usage) is a cow.

	
	A young female before she has had a calf of her own17 and is under three years of age is called a heifer (/.
h.
f.
r/ HEF-.
r).

	18 A young female that has had only one calf is occasionally called a first-calf heifer.

	
	Young cattle of both sexes are called calves until they are weaned, then weaners until they are a year old in some areas; in other areas, particularly with male beef cattle, they may be known as feeder calves or simply feeders.

	 After that, they are referred to as yearlings or stirks19 if between one and two years of age.

	20
	A castrated male is called a steer in the United States; older steers are often called bullocks in other parts of the world,21but in North America this term refers to a young bull.

	 Piker bullocks are micky bulls (uncastrated young male bulls) that were caught, castrated and then later lost.

	16 In Australia, the term Japanese ox is used for grain-fed steers in the weight range of 500 to 650 kg that are destined for the Japanese meat trade.

	22 In North America, draft cattle under four years old are called working steers.

	 Improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer known as a stag in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

	23 In some countries, an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig.

	
	A castrated male (occasionally a female or in some areas a bull) kept for draft purposes is called an ox (plural oxen); oxmay also be used to refer to some carcass products from any adult cattle, such as ox-hide, ox-blood, oxtail, or ox-liver.

	18
	A springer is a cow or heifer close to calving.

	24
	In all cattle species, a female twin of a bull usually becomes an infertile partial intersex, and is called a freemartin.

	
	Neat (horned oxen, from which neatsfoot oil is derived), beef (young ox) and beefing (young animal fit for slaughtering) are obsolete terms, although poll, pollard and polled cattle are still terms in use for naturally hornless animals, or in some areas also for those that have been disbuddedor dehorned.

	
	Cattle raised for human consumption are called beef cattle.

	 Within the American beef cattle industry, the older term beef (plural beeves) is still used to refer to an animal of either sex.

	 Some Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and British people use the term beast.

	25
	Cattle bred specifically for milk production are called milking or dairy cattle;15 a cow kept to provide milk for one family may be called a house cow or milker.

	 A fresh cow is a dairy term for a cow or first-calf heifer who has recently given birth, or "freshened.

	"
	The adjective applying to cattle in general is usually bovine.

	 The terms bull, cow and calf are also used by extension to denote the sex or age of other large animals, including whales, hippopotamuses, camels, elk and elephants.

Singular terminology issue
Cattle can only be used in the plural and not in the singular: it is a plurale tantum.

26 Thus one may refer to "three cattle" or "some cattle", but not "one cattle".

 No universally used singular form in modern English of cattle exists, other than the sex- and age-specific terms such as cow, bull, steer and heifer.

 Historically, "ox" was not a sex-specific term for adult cattle, but generally this is now used only for draft cattle, especially adult castrated males.

 The term is also incorporated into the names of other species, such as the musk ox and "grunting ox" (yak), and is used in some areas to describe certain cattle products such as ox-hide and oxtail.

27

A Brahman calf
Cow is in general use as a singular for the collective cattle, despite the objections by those who insist it to be a female-specific term.

 Although the phrase "that cow is a bull" is absurd from a lexicographic standpoint, the word cow is easy to use when a singular is needed and the sex is unknown or irrelevant ¡V when "there is a cow in the road", for example.

 Further, any herd of fully mature cattle in or near a pasture is statistically likely to consist mostly of cows, so the term is probably accurate even in the restrictive sense.

 Other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated as calves and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years.

 Thus, in a pastured herd, any calves or herd bulls usually are clearly distinguishable from the cows due to distinctively different sizes and clear anatomical differences.

 Merriam-Webster, a US dictionary, recognizes the sex-nonspecific use of cow as an alternate definition,28 whereas Collins and the OED, UK dictionaries, do not.


Colloquially, more general nonspecific terms may denote cattle when a singular form is needed.

 Australian, New Zealand and British farmers use the term beast or cattle beast.

 Bovine is also used in Britain.

 The term critter is common in the western United States and Canada, particularly when referring to young cattle.

29 In some areas of the American South (particularly the Appalachian region), where both dairy and beef cattle are present, an individual animal was once called a "beef critter", though that term is becoming archaic.

Cattle raised for human consumption are called beef cattle.

 Within the beef cattle industry in parts of the United States, the term beef (plural beeves) is still used in its archaic sense to refer to an animal of either sex.

 Cows of certain breeds that are kept for the milk they give are called dairy cows or milking cows (formerly milch cows).

 Most young male offspring of dairy cows are sold for veal, and may be referred to as veal calves.


The term dogies is used to describe orphaned calves in the context of ranch work in the American West, as in "Keep them dogies moving".

30 In some places, a cow kept to provide milk for one family is called a "house cow".

 Other obsolete terms for cattle include "neat" (this use survives in "neatsfoot oil", extracted from the feet and legs of cattle), and "beefing" (young animal fit for slaughter).


An onomatopoeic term for one of the most common sounds made by cattle is moo (also called lowing).

 There are a number of other sounds made by cattle, including calves bawling, and bulls bellowing.

 Bawling is most common for cows after weaning of a calf.

 The bullroarer makes a sound similar to a bull's territorial call.

Characteristics
Anatomy
Displayed skeleton of a domestic cow
Cattle are large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves.

 Most breeds have horns, which can be as large as the Texas Longhorn or small like a scur.

 Careful genetic selection has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread.



Anatomy model of a cow
Digestive system
Cattle are ruminants, meaning their digestive system is highly specialized to allow the use of poorly digestible plants as food.

 Cattle have one stomach with four compartments, the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the rumen being the largest compartment.

 The reticulum, the smallest compartment, is known as the "honeycomb".

 Cattle sometimes consume metal objects which are deposited in the reticulum and irritation from the metal objects causes hardware disease.

 The omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed.

 The omasum is known as the "many plies".

 The abomasum is like the human stomach; this is why it is known as the "true stomach".


Cattle are known for regurgitating and re-chewing their food, known as cud chewing, like most ruminants.

 While the animal is feeding, the food is swallowed without being chewed and goes into the rumen for storage until the animal can find a quiet place to continue the digestion process.

 The food is regurgitated, a mouthful at a time, back up to the mouth, where the food, now called the cud, is chewed by the molars, grinding down the coarse vegetation to small particles.

 The cud is then swallowed again and further digested by specialized microorganisms in the rumen.

 These microbes are primarily responsible for decomposing cellulose and other carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids cattle use as their primary metabolic fuel.

 The microbes inside the rumen also synthesize amino acids from non-protein nitrogenous sources, such as urea and ammonia.

 As these microbes reproduce in the rumen, older generations die and their cells continue on through the digestive tract.

 These cells are then partially digested in the small intestines, allowing cattle to gain a high-quality protein source.

 These features allow cattle to thrive on grasses and other tough vegetation.


Gestation and size
The gestation period for a cow is about nine months long.

 A newborn calf's size can vary among breeds, but a typical calf weighs between 25 to 45 kg (55 to 99 lb).

 Adult size and weight vary significantly among breeds and sex.

 Steers are generally killed before reaching 750 kg (1,650 lb).

 Breeding stock may be allowed a longer lifespan, occasionally living as long as 25 years.

 The oldest recorded cow, Big Bertha, died at the age of 48 in 1993.


Reproduction

Reproductive system of a bovine female.



Ox testis.


On farms it is very common to use artificial insemination (AI)), a medically assisted reproduction technique consisting of the artificial deposition of semen in the female's genital tract.

32 It is used in cases where the spermatozoa can not reach the fallopian tubes or simply by choice of the owner of the animal.

 It consists of transferring, to the uterine cavity, spermatozoa previously collected and processed, with the selection of morphologically more normal and mobile spermatozoa.


A cow's udder contains two pairs of mammary glands, (commonly referred to as teats) creating four "quarters".

33 The front ones are referred to as fore quarters and the rear ones rear quarters.

34
Further information: Bull ¡± Reproductive anatomy
Bulls become fertile at about seven months of age.

 Their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum: a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches 28 centimetres (11 in); that of a fully adult bull may be over 40 centimetres (16 in).

3536
Bulls have a fibro-elastic penis.

 Given the small amount of erectile tissue, there is little enlargement after erection.

 The penis is quite rigid when non-erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection.

 Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.

373839
Induced ovulation can be manipulated to produce farming benefits.

 For example, to synchronise ovulation of the cattle to benefit dairy farming.


Weight
The world record for the heaviest bull was 1,740 kg (3,840 lb), a Chianina named Donetto, when he was exhibited at the Arezzo show in 1955.

40 The heaviest steer was eight-year-old ¡¥Old Ben¡¦, a Shorthorn/Hereford cross weighing in at 2,140 kg (4,720 lb) in 1910.

41
The weight of adult cattle varies, depending on the breed.

 Smaller kinds, such as Dexter and Jersey adults, range between 272 to 454 kg (600 to 1,000 lb).

 Large Continental breeds, such as Charolais, Marchigiana, Belgian Blue and Chianina, adults range from 635 to 1,134 kg (1,400 to 2,500 lb).

 British breeds, such as Hereford, Angus, and Shorthorn, mature between 454 to 907 kg (1,000 to 2,000 lb), occasionally higher, particularly with Angus and Hereford.

42
Bulls will be a bit larger than cows of the same breed by a few hundred kilograms.

 Chianina bulls can weigh up to 1,500 kg (3,300 lb); British bulls, such as Angus and Hereford, can weigh as little as 907 kg (2,000 lb) to as much as 1,361 kg (3,000 lb).

citation needed
It is difficult to generalize or average out the weight of all cattle because different kinds have different averages of weights.

 However, according to some sources, the average weight of all cattle is 753 kg (1,660 lb).

 Finishing steers in the feedlot average about 640 kg (1,410 lb); cows about 725 kg (1,600 lb), and bulls about 1,090 kg (2,400 lb).

43
In the United States, the average weight of beef cattle has steadily increased, especially since the 1970s, requiring the building of new slaughterhouses able to handle larger carcasses.

 New packing plants in the 1980s stimulated a large increase in cattle weights.

44 Before 1790 beef cattle averaged only 160 kg (350 lb) net; and thereafter weights climbed steadily.

Cognition
In laboratory studies, young cattle are able to memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8 hours, although this declined after 12 hours.

47 Fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their longer-term memory is less stable.

48Mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks and have a good long-term memory in these tests.

 Cattle tested in a radial arm maze are able to remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days.

 Although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration.

49 Under less artificial testing conditions, young cattle showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days.

50 Cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day ¡V memory of this association can be retained for 1 year, despite a slight decay.

51
Calves are capable of discrimination learning52 and adult cattle compare favourably with small mammals in their learning ability in the Closed-field Test.

53
They are also able to discriminate between familiar individuals, and among humans.

 Cattle can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar animals of the same species (conspecifics).

 Studies show they behave less aggressively toward familiar individuals when they are forming a new group.

54 Calves can also discriminate between humans based on previous experience, as shown by approaching those who handled them positively and avoiding those who handled them aversively.

55Although cattle can discriminate between humans by their faces alone, they also use other cues such as the color of clothes when these are available.

56
In audio play-back studies, calves prefer their own mother's vocalizations compared to the vocalizations of an unfamiliar mother.

57
In laboratory studies using images, cattle can discriminate between images of the heads of cattle and other animal species.

58 They are also able to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics.

 Furthermore, they are able to categorize images as familiar and unfamiliar individuals.

54
When mixed with other individuals, cloned calves from the same donor form subgroups, indicating that kin discrimination occurs and may be a basis of grouping behaviour.

 It has also been shown using images of cattle that both artificially inseminated and cloned calves have similar cognitive capacities of kin and non-kin discrimination.

59
Cattle can recognize familiar individuals.

 Visual individual recognition is a more complex mental process than visual discrimination.

 It requires the recollection of the learned idiosyncratic identity of an individual that has been previously encountered and the formation of a mental representation.

60 By using 2-dimensional images of the heads of one cow (face, profiles, .
 views), all the tested heifers showed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed.

 Furthermore, almost all the heifers recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, although this was achieved with greater difficulty.

 Individual recognition was most difficult when the visual features of the breed being tested were quite different from the breed in the image, for example, the breed being tested had no spots whereas the image was of a spotted breed.

61
Cattle use visual/brain lateralisation in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli.

62 Domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye, i.

e.

 using the right brain hemisphere (similar to horses, Australian magpies, chicks, toads and fish) but use the right eye, i.

e.

 using the left hemisphere, for viewing familiar stimuli.

63
Temperament and emotions

Ear postures of cows are studied as indicators of their emotional state and overall animal welfare.

64
In cattle, temperament can affect production traits such as carcass and meat quality or milk yield as well as affecting the animal's overall health and reproduction.

 Cattle temperament is defined as "the consistent behavioral and physiological difference observed between individuals in response to a stressor or environmental challenge and is used to describe the relatively stable difference in the behavioral predisposition of an animal, which can be related to psychobiological mechanisms".

65 Generally, cattle temperament is assumed to be multidimensional.

 Five underlying categories of temperament traits have been proposed:66
	shyness-boldness
	exploration-avoidance
	activity
	aggressiveness
	sociability
In a study on Holstein¡VFriesian heifers learning to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward, the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food.

 When the heifers made clear improvements in learning, they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race.

 The researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement.

67
Negative emotional states are associated with a bias toward negative (pessimistic) responses towards ambiguous cues in judgement tasks ¡V as encapsulated in the question of "is the glass half empty or half full".

 After separation from their mothers, Holstein calves showed such a cognitive bias indicative of low mood.

68 A similar study showed that after hot-iron disbudding (dehorning), calves had a similar negative bias indicating that post-operative pain following this routine procedure results in a negative change in emotional state.

69
In studies of visual discrimination, the position of the ears has been used as an indicator of emotional state.

54 When cattle are stressed, this can be recognised by other cattle as it is communicated by alarm substances in the urine.

70
Cattle are very gregarious and even short-term isolation is considered to cause severe psychological stress.

 When Aubrac and Fresian heifers are isolated, they increase their vocalizations and experience increased heart rate and plasma cortisol concentrations.

 These physiological changes are greater in Aubracs.

 When visual contact is re-instated, vocalisations rapidly decline, regardless of the familiarity of the returning cattle, however, heart rate decreases are greater if the returning cattle are familiar to the previously-isolated individual.

71 Mirrors have been used to reduce stress in isolated cattle.

72
Senses
Cattle use all of the five widely recognized sensory modalities.

 These can assist in some complex behavioural patterns, for example, in grazing behaviour.

 Cattle eat mixed diets, but when given the opportunity, show a partial preference of approximately 70% clover and 30% grass.

 This preference has a diurnal pattern, with a stronger preference for clover in the morning, and the proportion of grass increasing towards the evening.

73
Vision
Vision is the dominant sense in cattle and they obtain almost 50% of their information visually.

 74
Cattle are a prey animal and to assist predator detection, their eyes are located on the sides of their head rather than the front.

 This gives them a wide field of view of 330¢X but limits binocular vision (and therefore stereopsis) to 30¢X to 50¢X compared to 140¢X in humans.

5475 This means they have a blind spot directly behind them.

 Cattle have good visual acuity (1/20)54 but compared to humans, the visual accommodation of cattle is poor.

74
Cattle have two kinds of color receptors in the cone cells of their retinas.

 This means that cattle are dichromatic, as are most other non-primate land mammals.

7677There are two to three rods per cone in the fovea centralis but five to six near the optic papilla.

75 Cattle can distinguish long wavelength colors (yellow, orange and red) much better than the shorter wavelengths (blue, grey and green).

 Calves are able to discriminate between long (red) and short (blue) or medium (green) wavelengths, but have limited ability to discriminate between the short and medium.

 They also approach handlers more quickly under red light.

78 Whilst having good color sensitivity, it is not as good as humans or sheep.

54
A common misconception about cattle (particularly bulls) is that they are enraged by the color red (something provocative is often said to be "like a red flag to a bull").

 This is a myth.

 In bullfighting, it is the movement of the red flag or cape that irritates the bull and incites it to charge.

79
Taste
Cattle have a well-developed sense of taste and can distinguish the four primary tastes (sweet, salty, bitter and sour).

 They possess around 20,000 taste buds.

 The strength of taste perception depends on the individual's current food requirements.

 They avoid bitter-tasting foods (potentially toxic) and have a marked preference for sweet (high calorific value) and salty foods (electrolyte balance).

 Their sensitivity to sour-tasting foods helps them to maintain optimal ruminal pH.

74
Plants have low levels of sodium and cattle have developed the capacity of seeking salt by taste and smell.

 If cattle become depleted of sodium salts, they show increased locomotion directed to searching for these.

 To assist in their search, the olfactory and gustatory receptors able to detect minute amounts of sodium salts increase their sensitivity as biochemical disruption develops with sodium salt depletion.

8081
Audition
Cattle hearing ranges from 23 Hz to 35 kHz.

 Their frequency of best sensitivity is 8 kHz and they have a lowest threshold of .
21 db (re 20 £gN/m.
2), which means their hearing is more acute than horses (lowest threshold of 7 db).

82 Sound localization acuity thresholds are an average of 30¢X.

 This means that cattle are less able to localise sounds compared to goats (18¢X), dogs (8¢X) and humans (0.

8¢X).

83 Because cattle have a broad foveal fields of view covering almost the entire horizon, they may not need very accurate locus information from their auditory systems to direct their gaze to a sound source.


Vocalisations are an important mode of communication amongst cattle and can provide information on the age, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of the caller.

 Calves can recognize their mothers using vocal and vocal behaviour may play a role by indicating estrus and competitive display by bulls.

84
Olfaction and gustation

Several senses are used in social relationships between cattle
Cattle have a range of odiferous glands over their body including interdigital, infraorbital, inguinal and sebaceous glands, indicating that olfaction probably plays a large role in their social life.

 Both the primary olfactory system using the olfactory bulbs, and the secondary olfactory system using the vomeronasal organ are used.

85 This latter olfactory system is used in the flehmen response.

 There is evidence that when cattle are stressed, this can be recognised by other cattle and this is communicated by alarm substances in the urine.

70 The odour of dog faeces induces behavioural changes prior to cattle feeding, whereas the odours of urine from either stressed or non-stressed conspecifics and blood have no effect.

86
In the laboratory, cattle can be trained to recognise conspecific individuals using olfaction only.

85
In general, cattle use their sense of smell to "expand" on information detected by other sensory modalities.

 However, in the case of social and reproductive behaviours, olfaction is a key source of information.

74
Touch
Cattle have tactile sensations detected mainly by mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and nociceptors in the skin and muzzle.

 These are used most frequently when cattle explore their environment.

74
Magnetoreception
There is conflicting evidence for magnetoreception in cattle.

 One study reported that resting and grazing cattle tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic North-South (N-S) direction.

87 In a follow-up study, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment.

88 However, in 2011, a group of Czech researchers reported their failed attempt to replicate the finding using Google Earth images.

89
Behavior
Under natural conditions, calves stay with their mother until weaning at 8 to 11 months.

 Heifer and bull calves are equally attached to their mothers in the first few months of life.

90 Cattle are considered to be "hider" type animals, but in the artificial environment of small calving pens, close proximity between cow and calf is maintained by the mother at the first three calvings but this changes to being mediated by the calf after these.

 Primiparous dams show a higher incidence of abnormal maternal behavior.

91

Video of a calf suckling
Beef-calves reared on the range suckle an average of 5.

0 times every 24 hours with an average total time of 46 min spent suckling.

 There is a diurnal rhythm in suckling activity with peaks between 05:00¡V07:00, 10:00¡V13:00 and 17:00¡V21:00.

92
Studies on the natural weaning of zebu cattle (Bos indicus) have shown that the cow weans her calves over a 2-week period, but after that, she continues to show strong affiliatory behavior with her offspring and preferentially chooses them for grooming and as grazing partners for at least 4¡V5 years.

93
Reproductive behavior

A cow giving birth
Semi-wild Highland cattle heifers first give birth at 2 or 3 years of age, and the timing of birth is synchronized with increases in natural food quality.

 Average calving interval is 391 days, and calving mortality within the first year of life is 5%.

94
Dominance and leadership
One study showed that over a 4-year period, dominance relationships within a herd of semi-wild highland cattle were very firm.

 There were few overt aggressive conflicts and the majority of disputes were settled by agonistic (non-aggressive, competitive) behaviors that involved no physical contact between opponents (e.

g.

 threatening and spontaneous withdrawing).

 Such agonistic behavior reduces the risk of injury.

 Dominance status depended on age and sex, with older animals generally being dominant to young ones and males dominant to females.

 Young bulls gained superior dominance status over adult cows when they reached about 2 years of age.

94
As with many animal dominance hierarchies, dominance-associated aggressiveness does not correlate with rank position, but is closely related to rank distance between individuals.

94
Dominance is maintained in several ways.

 Cattle often engage in mock fights where they test each other's strength in a non-aggressive way.

 Licking is primarily performed by subordinates and received by dominant animals.

 Mounting is a playful behavior shown by calves of both sexes and by bulls and sometimes by cows in estrus,95 however, this is not a dominance related behavior as has been found in other species.

94
The horns of cattle are "honest signals" used in mate selection.

 Furthermore, horned cattle attempt to keep greater distances between themselves and have fewer physical interactions than hornless cattle.

 This leads to more stable social relationships.

96
In calves, the frequency of agonistic behavior decreases as space allowance increases, but this does not occur for changes in group size.

 However, in adult cattle, the number of agonistic encounters increases as the group size increases.

97
Grazing behavior
When grazing, cattle vary several aspects of their bite, i.

e.

 tongue and jaw movements, depending on characteristics of the plant they are eating.

 Bite area decreases with the density of the plants but increases with their height.

 Bite area is determined by the sweep of the tongue; in one study observing 750-kilogram (1,650 lb) steers, bite area reached a maximum of approximately 170 cm2 (30 sq in).

 Bite depth increases with the height of the plants.

 By adjusting their behavior, cattle obtain heavier bites in swards that are tall and sparse compared with short, dense swards of equal mass/area.

98 Cattle adjust other aspects of their grazing behavior in relation to the available food; foraging velocity decreases and intake rate increases in areas of abundant palatable forage.

99
Cattle avoid grazing areas contaminated by the faeces of other cattle more strongly than they avoid areas contaminated by sheep,100 but they do not avoid pasture contaminated by rabbit faeces.

Genetics
Further information: Bovine genome
In the 24 April 2009, edition of the journal Science, a team of researchers led by the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Agriculture reported having mapped the bovine genome.

102 The scientists found cattle have about 22,000 genes, and 80% of their genes are shared with humans, and they share about 1000 genes with dogs and rodents, but are not found in humans.

 Using this bovine "HapMap", researchers can track the differences between the breeds that affect the quality of meat and milk yields.

103
Behavioral traits of cattle can be as heritable as some production traits, and often, the two can be related.

104 The heritability of fear varies markedly in cattle from low (0.

1) to high (0.

53); such high variation is also found in pigs and sheep, probably due to differences in the methods used.

105 The heritability of temperament (response to isolation during handling) has been calculated as 0.

36 and 0.

46 for habituation to handling.

106 Rangeland assessments show that the heritability of aggressiveness in cattle is around 0.

36.

107
Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been found for a range of production and behavioral characteristics for both dairy and beef cattle.

108
Domestication and husbandry

Texas Longhorns are a US breed
Cattle occupy a unique role in human history, having been domesticated since at least the early neolithic age.


Archeozoological and genetic data indicate that cattle were first domesticated from wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) approximately 10,500 years ago.

 There were two major areas of domestication: one in the area that is now Turkey, giving rise to the taurine line, and a second in the area that is now Pakistan, resulting in the indicine line.

109 Modern mitochondrial DNA variation indicates the taurine line may have arisen from as few as 80 aurochs tamed in the upper reaches of Mesopotamianear the villages of Cayonu Tepesi in southeastern Turkey and Dja'de el-Mughara in northern Iraq.

1
Although European cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage, gene flow from African cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern European cattle breeds and their New World descendants.

109 A study on 134 breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and Europe.

110 Some researchers have suggested that African taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from North African aurochsen.

109
Usage as money
As early as 9000 BC both grain and cattle were used as money or as barter (Davies) (the first grain remains found, considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC).

111112113 Some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals, such as camels and goats, may have been used as currency in some parts of the world.

114 One of the advantages of using cattle as currency is that it allows the seller to set a fixed price.

 It even created the standard pricing.

 For example, two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens.

112
Modern husbandry

This Hereford is being inspected for ticks; cattle are often restrained or confined in cattle crushes (squeeze chutes) when given medical attention.



This young bovine has a nose ringto prevent it from suckling, which is usually to assist in weaning.


Cattle are often raised by allowing herds to graze on the grasses of large tracts of rangeland.

 Raising cattle in this manner allows the use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops.

 The most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding, cleaning and milking.

 Many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging, dehorning, loading, medical operations, vaccinations and hoof care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations.

 Also, some cultural differences occur in working with cattle; the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on behavioural techniques, whereas in Europe, cattle are controlled primarily by physical means, such as fences.

115 Breeders use cattle husbandry to reduce M.

 bovis infectionsusceptibility by selective breeding and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease.

116
Cattle are farmed for beef, veal, dairy, and leather, and they are less commonly used for conservation grazing, simply to maintain grassland for wildlife ¡V for example, in Epping Forest, England.

 They are often used in some of the most wild places for livestock.

 Depending on the breed, cattle can survive on hill grazing, heaths, marshes, moors and semidesert.

 Modern cattle are more commercial than older breeds and, having become more specialized, are less versatile.

 For this reason, many smaller farmers still favor old breeds, such as the Jersey dairy breed.

 In Portugal, Spain, southern France and some Latin American countries, bulls are used in the activity of bullfighting; Jallikattu in India is a bull taming sport radically different from European bullfighting, humans are unarmed and bulls are not killed.

 In many other countries bullfighting is illegal.

 Other activities such as bull riding are seen as part of a rodeo, especially in North America.

 Bull-leaping, a central ritual in Bronze Age Minoan culture (see Sacred Bull), still exists in southwestern France.

 In modern times, cattle are also entered into agricultural competitions.

 These competitions can involve live cattle or cattle carcases in hoof and hook events.


In terms of food intake by humans, consumption of cattle is less efficient than of grain or vegetables with regard to land use, and hence cattle grazing consumes more area than such other agricultural production when raised on grains.

117 Nonetheless, cattle and other forms of domesticated animals can sometimes help to use plant resources in areas not easily amenable to other forms of agriculture.


Sleep
Further information: Sleep in non-human animals and Cow tipping
The average sleep time of a domestic cow is about 4 hours a day.

118 Cattle do have a stay apparatus,119 but do not sleep standing up,120 they lie down to sleep deeply.

121 In spite of the urban legend, cows cannot be tipped over by people pushing on them.

122
Economy

Holstein cattle are the primary dairy breed, bred for high milk production.


The meat of adult cattle is known as beef, and that of calves is veal.

 Other animal parts are also used as food products, including blood, liver, kidney, heart and oxtail.

 Cattle also produce milk, and dairy cattle are specifically bred to produce the large quantities of milk processed and sold for human consumption.

 Cattle today are the basis of a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide.

 The international trade in beef for 2000 was over $30 billion and represented only 23% of world beef production.

123The production of milk, which is also made into cheese, butter, yogurt, and other dairy products, is comparable in economic size to beef production, and provides an important part of the food supply for many of the world's people.

 Cattle hides, used for leather to make shoes, couches and clothing, are another widespread product.

 Cattle remain broadly used as draft animals in many developing countries, such as India.

 Cattle are also used in some sporting games, including rodeo and bullfighting.

About half the world's meat comes from cattle.

Dairy
Main articles: Dairy cattle, Dairy farming, and Dairy

Dairy farming and the milking of cattle was once performed largely by hand, but is now usually replaced by machine
Certain breeds of cattle, such as the Holstein-Friesian, are used to produce milk,126127 which can be processed into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt.

 Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production.

 Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product.

128 For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year.

 If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered at a young age to produce veal.

129 They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth.

127 Over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow.

 The Holstein-Friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the UK, Europe and the United States.

 It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow.

 Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.

126127
Hides
Most cattle are not kept solely for hides, which are usually a by-product of beef production.

 Hides are most commonly used for leather which can be made into a variety of product including shoes.

 In 2012 India was the world's largest producer of cattle hides.

130
Feral cattle
Feral cattle are defined as being 'cattle that are not domesticated or cultivated'.

131 Populations of feral cattle are known to come from and exist in: Australia, United States of America, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, France and many islands, including New Guinea, Hawaii, Galapagos, Juan Fernandez Islands, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), Tristan da Cunha and Ile Amsterdam,132 two islands of Kuchinoshima133 and Kazura Island next to Naru Island in Japan.

134135 Chillingham cattle is sometimes regarded as a feral breed.

136 Aleutian wild cattles can be found on Aleutian Islands.

137 The "Kinmen cattle" which is dominantly found on Kinmen Island, Taiwan is mostly domesticated while smaller portion of the population is believed to live in the wild due to accidental releases.

138
Other notable examples include cattles vicinity to Hong Kong (in the Shing Mun Country Park,139 among Sai Kung District140 and Lantau Island141 and on Grass Island142), and semi-feral animals in Yangmingshan, Taiwan.

143
Environmental impact
See also: Environmental effects of meat production

Cattle in dry landscape north of Alice Springs, Australia (CSIRO)
Cattle near the Bruneau River in Elko County, Nevada
Gut flora in cattle include methanogens that produce methane as a byproduct of enteric fermentation, which cattle belch out.

 The same volume of atmospheric methane has a higher global warming potential than atmospheric carbon dioxide.

144145 Methane belching from cattle can be reduced with genetic selection, immunization, rumen defaunation, diet modification and grazing management, among others.

146147148
A report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that the livestock sector is "responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions".

149 The IPCC estimates that Cattle and other livestock emit about 80 to 93 Megatonnes of methane per year,150accounting for an estimated 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions,149 and additional methane is produced by anaerobic fermentation of manure in manure lagoons and other manure storage structures.

151 The net change in atmospheric methane content was recently about 1 Megatonne per year,152 and in some recent years there has been no increase in atmospheric methane content.

153 While cattle fed forage actually produce more methane than grain-fed cattle, the increase may be offset by the increased carbon recapture of pastures, which recapture three times the CO2 of cropland used for grain.

154
One of the cited changes suggested to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is intensification of the livestock industry, since intensification leads to less land for a given level of production.

 This assertion is supported by studies of the US beef production system, suggesting practices prevailing in 2007 involved 8.

6% less fossil fuel use, 16.

3% less greenhouse gas emissions, 12.

1% less water use, and 33.

0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than those used in 1977.

155 The analysis took into account not only practices in feedlots, but also feed production (with less feed needed in more intensive production systems), forage-based cow-calf operations and back-grounding before cattle enter a feedlot (with more beef produced per head of cattle from those sources, in more intensive systems), and beef from animals derived from the dairy industry.


The number of American cattle kept in confined feedlot conditions fluctuates.

 From 1 January 2002 through 1 January 2012, there was no significant overall upward or downward trend in the number of US cattle on feed for slaughter, which averaged about 14.

046 million head over that period.

156157 Previously, the number had increased; it was 12.

453 million in 1985.

158Cattle on feed (for slaughter) numbered about 14.

121 million on 1 January 2012, i.

e.

 about 15.

5% of the estimated inventory of 90.

8 million US cattle (including calves) on that date.

 Of the 14.

121 million, US cattle on feed (for slaughter) in operations with 1000 head or more were estimated to number 11.

9 million.

157 Cattle feedlots in this size category correspond to the regulatory definition of "large" concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) for cattle other than mature dairy cows or veal calves.

159 Significant numbers of dairy, as well as beef cattle, are confined in CAFOs, defined as "new and existing operations which stable or confine and feed or maintain for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period more than the number of animals specified"160 where "crops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility.

"161 They may be designated as small, medium and large.

 Such designation of cattle CAFOs is according to cattle type (mature dairy cows, veal calves or other) and cattle numbers, but medium CAFOs are so designated only if they meet certain discharge criteria, and small CAFOs are designated only on a case-by-case basis.

162
A CAFO that discharges pollutants is required to obtain a permit, which requires a plan to manage nutrient runoff, manure, chemicals, contaminants, and other wastewater pursuant to the US Clean Water Act.

163 The regulations involving CAFO permitting have been extensively litigated.

164 Commonly, CAFO wastewater and manure nutrients are applied to land at agronomic rates for use by forages or crops, and it is often assumed that various constituents of wastewater and manure, e.

g.

 organic contaminants and pathogens, will be retained, inactivated or degraded on the land with application at such rates; however, additional evidence is needed to test reliability of such assumptions .

165 Concerns raised by opponents of CAFOs have included risks of contaminated water due to feedlot runoff,166 soil erosion, human and animal exposure to toxic chemicals, development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and an increase in E.

 coli contamination.

167 While research suggests some of these impacts can be mitigated by developing wastewater treatment systems166 and planting cover crops in larger setback zones,168 the Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in 2008 concluding that CAFOs are generally unsustainable and externalize costs.

154
An estimated 935,000 cattle operations were operating in the USA in 2010.

169 In 2001, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tallied 5,990 cattle CAFOs then regulated, consisting of beef (2,200), dairy (3,150), heifer (620) and veal operations (20).

170 Since that time, the EPA has established CAFOs as an enforcement priority.

 EPA enforcement highlights for fiscal year 2010 indicated enforcement actions against 12 cattle CAFOs for violations that included failures to obtain a permit, failures to meet the terms of a permit, and discharges of contaminated water.

171

Another concern is manure, which if not well-managed, can lead to adverse environmental consequences.

 However, manure also is a valuable source of nutrients and organic matter when used as a fertilizer.

172 Manure was used as a fertilizer on about 15.

8 million acres of US cropland in 2006, with manure from cattle accounting for nearly 70% of manure applications to soybeans and about 80% or more of manure applications to corn, wheat, barley, oats and sorghum.

173 Substitution of manure for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 megajoules of fossil fuel energy would be used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.

174
Grazing by cattle at low intensities can create a favourable environment for native herbs and forbs; in many world regions, though, cattle are reducing biodiversity due to overgrazing.

175 A survey of refuge managers on 123 National Wildlife Refuges in the US tallied 86 species of wildlife considered positively affected and 82 considered negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying.

176 Proper management of pastures, notably managed intensive rotational grazing and grazing at low intensities can lead to less use of fossil fuel energy, increased recapture of carbon dioxide, fewer ammonia emissions into the atmosphere, reduced soil erosion, better air quality, and less water pollution.

154
Health
The veterinary discipline dealing with cattle and cattle diseases (bovine veterinary) is called buiatrics.

177 Veterinarians and professionals working on cattle health issues are pooled in the World Association for Buiatrics, founded in 1960.

178 National associations and affiliates also exist.

179
Cattle diseases were in the center of attention in the 1980s and 1990s when the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, was of concern.

 Cattle might catch and develop various other diseases, like blackleg, bluetongue, foot rot too.

180181182
In most states, as cattle health is not only a veterinarian issue, but also a public health issue, public health and food safety standards and farming regulations directly affect the daily work of farmers who keep cattle.

183 However, said rules change frequently and are often debated.

 For instance, in the U.

K.

, it was proposed in 2011 that milk from tuberculosis-infected cattle should be allowed to enter the food chain.

184 Internal food safety regulations might affect a country's trade policy as well.

 For example, the United States has just reviewed its beef import rules according to the "mad cow standards"; while Mexico forbids the entry of cattle who are older than 30 months.

185
Cow urine is commonly used in India for internal medical purposes.

186187 It is distilled and then consumed by patients seeking treatment for a wide variety of illnesses.

188 At present, no conclusive medical evidence shows this has any effect.

189 However, an Indian medicine containing cow urine has already obtained U.

S.

 patents.

190
Digital dermatitis is caused by the bacteria from the genus Treponema.

 It differs from foot rot and can appear under unsanitary conditions such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming, among other causes.

 It primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, however the milk quality remains unaffected.

 Cattle are also susceptible to ringworm caused by the fungus, Trichophyton verrucosum, a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows.

191
Mycobacterium vaccae is a non pathogenic, possibly even beneficial bacteria, that is seen naturally in soil;192 that was first isolated from cow dung.

193
Effect of high stocking density
Stocking density refers to the number of animals within a specified area.

 When stocking density reaches high levels, the behavioural needs of the animals may not be met.

 This can negatively influence health, welfare and production performance.

194
The effect of overstocking in cows can have a negative effect on milk production and reproduction rates which are two very important traits for dairy farmers.

 Overcrowding of cows in barns has been found to reduced feeding, resting and rumination.

194 Although they consume the same amount of dry matter within the span of a day, they consume the food at a much more rapid rate, and this behaviour in cows can lead to further complications.

195 The feeding behaviour of cows during their post-milking period is very important as it has been proven that the longer animals can eat after milking, the longer they will be standing up and therefore causing less contamination to the teat ends.

196 This is necessary to reduce the risk of mastitis as infection has been shown to increase the chances of embryonic loss.

197Sufficient rest is important for dairy cows because it is during this period that their resting blood flow increases up to 50%, this is directly proportionate to milk production.

196 Each additional hour of rest can be seen to translate to 2 to 3.

5 more pounds of milk per cow daily.

 Stocking densities of anything over 120% have been shown to decrease the amount of time cows spend lying down.

198
Cortisol is an important stress hormone; its plasma concentrations increase greatly when subjected to high levels of stress.

199 Increased concentration levels of cortisol have been associated with significant increases in gonadotrophin levels and lowered progestin levels.

 Reduction of stress is important in the reproductive state of cows as an increase in gonadotrophin and lowered progesterone levels may impinge on the ovulatory and lutenization process and to reduce the chances of successful implantation.

200 A high cortisol level will also stimulate the degradation of fats and proteins which may make it difficult for the animal to sustain its pregnancy if implanted successfully.

199
Oxen
Main article: Ox

Draft Zebus in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
Oxen (singular ox) are cattle trained as draft animals.

 Often they are adult, castrated males of larger breeds, although females and bulls are also used in some areas.

 Usually, an ox is over four years old due to the need for training and to allow it to grow to full size.

 Oxen are used for plowing, transport, hauling cargo, grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines, irrigationby powering pumps, and wagon drawing.

 Oxen were commonly used to skid logs in forests, and sometimes still are, in low-impact, select-cut logging.

 Oxen are most often used in teams of two, paired, for light work such as carting, with additional pairs added when more power is required, sometimes up to a total of 20 or more.



Oxen used in Plowing
An ox is a mature bovine which has learned to respond appropriately to a teamster's signals.

 These signals are given by verbal commands or by noise (whip cracks).

 Verbal commands vary according to dialect and local tradition.

 In one tradition in North America, the commands are:citation needed
	"Back up": go backwards
	"Gee": turn right
	"Get up": walk forward
	"Haw": turn left
	"Whoa": stop

Riding an ox in Hova, Sweden
Oxen can pull harder and longer than horses.

 Though not as fast as horses, they are less prone to injury because they are more sure-footed.


Many oxen are used worldwide, especially in developing countries.

 About 11.

3 million draft oxen are used in sub-Saharan Africa.

201 In India, the number of draft cattle in 1998 was estimated at 65.

7 million head.

202 About half the world's crop production is thought to depend on land preparation (such as plowing) made possible by animal traction.

Hindu tradition
Further information: Cattle slaughter in India
Cattle are venerated within the Hindu religion of India.

 In the Vedic period they were a symbol of plenty 204:130 and were frequently slaughtered.

 In later times they gradually acquired their present status.

 According to the Mahabharata, they are to be treated with the same respect 'as one's mother'.

205 In the middle of the first millennium, the consumption of beef began to be disfavoured by lawgivers.

204:144 Although there has never been any cow-goddesses or temples dedicated to them,204:146cows appear in numerous stories from the Vedas and Puranas.

 The deity Krishna was brought up in a family of cowherders, and given the name Govinda (protector of the cows).

 Also, Shiva is traditionally said to ride on the back of a bull named Nandi.


Milk and milk products were used in Vedic rituals.

204:130 In the postvedic period products of the cow ¡V milk, curd, ghee, but also cow dung and urine (gomutra), or the combination of these five (panchagavya) ¡V began to assume an increasingly important role in ritual purification and expiation.

204:130¡V1
Veneration of the cow has become a symbol of the identity of Hindus as a community,204:20 especially since the end of the 19th century.

 Slaughter of cows (including oxen, bulls and calves) is forbidden by law in several states of the Indian Union.

 McDonald's outlets in India do not serve any beef burgers.

 In Maharaja Ranjit Singh's empire of the early 19th century, the killing of a cow was punishable by death.

Population
For 2013, the FAO estimated global cattle numbers at 1.

47 billion.

210 Regionally, the FAO estimate for 2013 includes: Asia 495 million; South America 348 million; Africa 305 million; Europe 122 million; North America 102 million; Central America 46 million; Oceania 42 million; and Caribbean 9 million.

 The following table shows the cattle population in 2009.

211
As of 2003, Africa had about 231 million head of cattle, raised in both traditional and non-traditional systems, but often an "integral" part of the culture and way of life.


The sheep (Ovis aries) is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock.

 Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates.

 Although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries.

 Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep.

 An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe (/ju.
/), an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb.


Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia.

 One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk.

 A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing.

 Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones.

 Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.


Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations.

 In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.


Sheepraising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect.

 Use of the word sheepbegan in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word sc.
ap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal.

 A group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob.

 Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.


Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology.

 As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery.

 Sheep figure in many mythologies¡Xsuch as the Golden Fleece¡Xand major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions.

 In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.

Characteristics
See also: History of the domestic sheep
Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral.

 Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans.

12 A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails.

 Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.

e.

 polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only.

 Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.

3
Another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color.

 Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited.

 Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald.

45 Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly.

 However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks.

45 While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning.

6 The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike.

 There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.



Suffolks are a medium wool, black-faced breed of meat sheep that make up 60% of the sheep population in the U.

S.

7
Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights.

 Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding.

7 Ewes typically weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms (100 and 220 lb), and rams between 45 and 160 kilograms (100 and 350 lb).

8 When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth.

9 Mature sheep have 32 teeth.

 As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw.

 These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed.

 There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines.

 This means that the dental formula for sheep is either 0.

3 10 There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.

 In the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age.

 The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal.

 For this reason, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years.

Skull
Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled.

13 Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270¢X to 320¢X, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads.

614 Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds.

 A few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face; for some individuals of these breeds, peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by "wool blindness", unless recently shorn about the face.

15 Sheep have poor depth perception; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk.

 In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas,16 and prefer to move uphill when disturbed.

 Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet.

 The purpose of these glands is uncertain,17 but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors.

7 The foot glands might also be related to reproduction,7 but alternative reasons, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.

17
Comparison with goats
Sheep and goats are closely related: both are in the subfamily Caprinae.

 However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile.

 A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and is not to be confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep.

 Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep.

 Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards.

 Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially).

 Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.

Breeds

See also: List of sheep breeds
The domestic sheep is a multi-purpose animal, and the more than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes.

318 Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds,1920 but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources.

612 However, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time: e.

g.

 863 breeds as of 1993,21 1314 breeds as of 199522 and 1229 breeds as of 2006.

23 (These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.

) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is "either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity.

"23 Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed.

 Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the topographyfor which the breed has been developed.

 This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds.

16 A sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.



The Barbados Blackbellyis a hair sheep breed of Caribbean origin.


Breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool.

 Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles.

 Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry.

 Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces.

24 Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks.

 Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth.

 Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types.

 For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.


Coarse or carpet wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness.

 Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds).

 As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes.

 Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.

25
A minor class of sheep are the dairy breeds.

 Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking.

 These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves.

26 In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.

27

The Li.
ka pramenka is a sheep breed of Croatian origin
A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all.

 Hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts.

 Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds.

 For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing.

25 Hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.

12
With the modern rise of corporate agribusiness and the decline of localized family farms, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction.

 The Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the UK lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals (each), and The Livestock Conservancy lists 14 as either "critical" or "threatened".

282930 Preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry.

25 Those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.


Diet
Sheep are exclusively herbivorous mammals.

 Most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume.

31 Both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition.

31 Sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.

31

Ruminant system of a sheep
Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down cellulosefrom stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates.

 When sheep graze, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus, which is then passed into the rumen, via the reticulum.

 The rumen is a 19- to 38-liter (5 to 10 gal) organ in which feed is fermented.

32 The fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.

33 (Other important rumen organisms include some archaea, which produce methane from carbon dioxide.

34) The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation.

32 After fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the reticulum and the omasum; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether.

 After the first three chambers, food moves into the abomasumfor final digestion before processing by the intestines.

 The abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the "true stomach".

35
Other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is hay, often during the winter months.

 The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet.

25 Also included in some sheep's diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks.

 Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep.

6 The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks.

36
Grazing behavior
Sheep follow a diurnal pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their cud.

 Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs.

37 Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands.

 Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.

38

Sheep grazing on public land
Effects on pasture
Sheep are largely grazing herbivores, unlike browsing animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage.

 With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle.

12 For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover.

1216 Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species.

 By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants.

 However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing.

39 Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields.

 Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds.

 Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa.

 In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.

40
Behavior

Sheep showing flocking behavior during a sheepdog trial
Flock behavior
Sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies.

 The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species.

41 Furthermore, in contrast to the red deer and gazelle (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges.

42 All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed,13 and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members.

7 During flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow and a leader may simply be the first individual to move.

 Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks.

6 Sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes.

 Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.

743
Flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep.

6Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered.

 Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture.

 This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.

6
In regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.

12
Herding

Escaped sheep being led back to pasture with the enticement of food.

 This method of moving sheep works best with smaller flocks.


Farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, and to move them more easily.

 For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability.

 Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food.

44 Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.

4546
Dominance hierarchy
Sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness.

 Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at troughs.

47 Primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy.

48 Rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so.

48 Merinos have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.

49
In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.

49
Intelligence and learning ability
Sheep are frequently thought of as unintelligent animals.

50 Their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated.

 Despite these perceptions, a University of Illinois monograph on sheep reported them to be just below pigs and on par with cattle in IQ.

6 Sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces, and remember them for years.

5152 In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics.

5152 If worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names and many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes.

6 Sheep have also responded well to clicker training.

6 Sheep have been used as pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.

6
It has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in West Yorkshire, England allegedly found a way to get over cattle gridsby rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.

A sheep bleat

Problems playing this file See media help.


Sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts.

 Bleating ("baaing") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, but also at times between other flock members.

54 The bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations.

55 Vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition.

54 A variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances.

 Apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain.

 Isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep.

56 Pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor.

57 Rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting; somewhat similar rumbling sounds may be made by the ewe,54 especially when with her neonate lambs.

 A snort (explosive exhalation through the nostrils) may signal aggression or a warning,5458 and is often elicited from startled sheep.

59
Senses

Lamb
In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide.

 In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298¢X to 325¢X, averaging 313.

1¢X, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.

5¢X to 74¢X, averaging 61.

7¢X.

60 In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause "wool blindness".

 In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.

1¢X to 303.

0¢X, averaging 269.

9¢X, and the binocular field ranged from 8.

9¢X to 77.

7¢X, averaging 47.

5¢X; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool,61 although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing.

 In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns,61 so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head.

 Sheep eyes exhibit very low hyperopia and little astigmatism.

 Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance.

60 Because sheep eyes have no accommodation, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image could be provided by the tapetum and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length.

60 Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in "visual cliff" experiments;6162 behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at one day old.

63 Sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours: black, red, brown, green, yellow and white.

64 Sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other.

65 Each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock.

 This constant monitoring is probably what keeps the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing.

 Sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.

66
Taste is the most important sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected.

 Touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.

67
The ram uses his vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) to sense the pheromones of ewes and detect when they are in estrus.

68 The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early recognition of her neonate lamb.

69
Reproduction
Main article: Domestic sheep reproduction

The second of twins being born.


Sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals.

 A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams.

25 Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round.

25 Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months.

25 However, there are exceptions.

 For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months.

70 Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days,71 during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams.

 A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality72 and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).

73747576
In feral sheep, rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes.

 Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely.

25 During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.

7
After mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months,77 and normal labor takes one to three hours.

78 Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.

779 During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs,80 small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.

A lamb's first steps
Ovine obstetrics can be problematic.

 By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding.

81 In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs.

25 After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb.

25 Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth.

25 In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk.

 Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.

82
After lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out.

25 Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well.

 Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep.

 Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons.

25 However, many would disagree with regard to timing.

 Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications.

8384 The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.

e.

 when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum is expected to have fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity.

858687 Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing.

88 Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated.

16 Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike.

89 Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.

Sheep may fall victim to poisons, infectious diseases, and physical injuries.

 As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators.

7 However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless.

90 Throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments.

 Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm.

 In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use.

91 However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions.

 In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530.

92 In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems.

67 Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals.

6793 The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.

25
Many breeders take a variety of preventive measures to ward off problems.

 The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased.

 Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior.

7 This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month.

 Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep.

 Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems.

94959697 Excessive stress can compromise the immune system.

97 "Shipping fever" (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur as a result of stress, notably during transport and (or) handling.

9899 Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline).

 Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria.

95 Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management.

 Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.

100

A sheep infected with orf, a disease transmittable to humans through skin contact
Common forms of preventive medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites.

 Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks.

7 Worms are the most common internal parasites.

 They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again).

 Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels.

 Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites.

16 External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots.

 Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal.

 Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly.

 Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike.

 Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated.

 In addition to other treatments, crutching(shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method.

 Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb.

101102 Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort.

 Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking.

 External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.

7
A wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep.

 Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies.

 These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding.

 Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep.

 Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes.

 Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.


A few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans.

 Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.

 Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool.

 More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women.

 Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks.

 The latter poses a slight risk to humans.

 During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.

Predators
Main article: Domestic sheep predation

A lamb being attacked by coyoteswith a bite to the throat
Other than parasites and disease, predation is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising.

 Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock.

 Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic.

7 However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region.

 In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem.

 In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation.

103 In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry.

7 Worldwide, canids¡Xincluding the domestic dog¡Xare responsible for most sheep deaths.

104105106 Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.

103107
Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation.

 Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing.

 Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used.

25 More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators,108 causing significant decreases in predator populations.

 In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.

109
The 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal.

16 Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs.

7 Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep.

25 In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.

Sheep are an important part of the global agricultural economy.

 However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow.

16 China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton.

110 Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products.

 Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers.

6111 Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade.

 Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.

Wool supplied by Australian farmers to dealers (tonnes/quarter) has been in decline since 1990
Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials.

 Wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics.

6 For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies.

6 Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation.

112 In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.

16
Sheepskin is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products.

 Byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value: sheep tallow can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin.

113 Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets.

3 Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper.

114 Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.

3
Some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep.

 Providing lambs for youth programs such as 4-H and competition at agricultural shows is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep.

115 Farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered purebred animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding.

116 A new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these "mowing services" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen fire hazard.

117
Despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock.

 They do not require expensive housing,118 such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs.

 They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse.

7119 Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate.

120 Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn.

121 Combined with the lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer.

121 Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness.

122
As food

Main articles: Lamb and mutton and Sheep milk
See also: Sheep milk cheese, List of sheep milk cheeses, Category:Sheep's-milk cheeses, and Sheep's trotters
Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.

7 Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb.

 "Mutton" is derived from the Old French moton, which was the word for sheep used by the Anglo-Norman rulers of much of the British Isles in the Middle Ages.

 This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the Old English word sceap was kept for the live animal.

123Throughout modern history, "mutton" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; "lamb" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.

124125126
In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland.

6 These countries eat 14¡V40 lbs (3¡V18 kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum.

6126 Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Maghreb), the Caribbean, the rest of the Middle East, India, and parts of China.

126 This often reflects a history of sheep production.

 In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional.

 Sheep testicles¡Xcalled animelles or lamb fries¡Xare considered a delicacy in many parts of the world.

 Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innardscooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach.

127 In comparison, countries such as the U.

S.

 consume only a pound or less (under 0.

5 kg), with Americans eating 50 pounds (22 kg) of pork and 65 pounds (29 kg) of beef.

126 In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.

6
Though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form,128 today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making.

 Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows.

7 However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process.

27 It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content.

27 Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgariaand Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy.

 Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk.

129 Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin.

6 Sheep milk contains 4.

8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.

6
As with other domestic animals, the meat of uncastrated males is inferior in quality, especially as they grow.

 A "bucky" lamb is a lamb which was not castrated early enough, or which was castrated improperly (resulting in one testicle being retained).

 These lambs are worth less at market.

In science

A cloned ewe named Dolly was a scientific landmark.



Ovine heart.


Sheep are generally too large and reproduce too slowly to make ideal research subjects, and thus are not a common model organism.

133 They have, however, played an influential role in some fields of science.

 In particular, the Roslin Institute of Edinburgh, Scotland used sheep for genetics research that produced groundbreaking results.

 In 1995, two ewes named Megan and Morag were the first mammals cloned from differentiated cells.

 A year later, a Finnish Dorset sheep named Dolly, dubbed "the world's most famous sheep" in Scientific American,134 was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell.

 Following this, Polly and Molly were the first mammals to be simultaneously cloned and transgenic.


As of 2008, the sheep genome has not been fully sequenced, although a detailed genetic map has been published,135 and a draft version of the complete genome produced by assembling sheep DNA sequences using information given by the genomes of other mammals.

136 In 2012, a transgenic sheep named "Peng Peng" was cloned by Chinese scientists, who spliced his genes with that of a roundworm (C.

 elegans) in order to increase production of fats healthier for human consumption.

137
In the study of natural selection, the population of Soay sheep that remain on the island of Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success.

138 Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively.

139 The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.

140
Sheep are one of the few animals where the molecular basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined.

141 However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams.

 Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep.

72 OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.

72
Domestic sheep are sometimes used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, in areas such as hypertension and heart failure.

142143 Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy,144 and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia.

145 In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.

146
Cultural impact
See also: Mammals in culture, List of fictional sheep, Bellwether, and Black sheep

The proverbial black sheep
Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock.

 In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led.

147 In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.


Counting sheep is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some ancient systems of counting sheep persist today.

 Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and idiom frequently with such phrases as "black sheep".

 To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group.

148 This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock.

 These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool.

148 Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the Portmanteau neologism of sheeple.

 Somewhat differently, the adjective "sheepish" is also used to describe embarrassment.

149
Religion and folklore

Ancient Greek red-figure ram-head rhyton, ca.

 340 BC
In antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the ancient Near East, the Mideast, and the Mediterraneanarea: Catalhoyuk, ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, Judaism, Greek religion, and others.

 Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths: Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Catalhoyuk settlement in 8,000 BCE.

150 In Ancient Egyptian religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods: Khnum, Heryshaf and Amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility).

6 Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess Ishtar, the Phoenician god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes.

6In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.

151
There are many ancient Greek references to sheep: that of Chrysomallos, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era.

 Astrologically, Aries, the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek zodiac, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the Chinese zodiac, related to the Chinese calendar.

151 In Mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.



Jesus is depicted as "The Good Shepherd", with the sheep being Christians
Sheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, King David and the Islamic prophetMuhammad were all shepherds.

 According to the Biblical story of the Binding of Isaac, a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael).

 Eid al-Adha is a major annual festival in Islam in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act.

152153 Sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important secular events in Islamic cultures.

154 Greeks and Romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and Judaism once sacrificed sheep as a Korban (sacrifice), such as the Passover lamb .

151 Ovine symbols¡Xsuch as the ceremonial blowing of a shofar¡Xstill find a presence in modern Judaic traditions.

 Followers of Christianity are collectively often referred to as a flock, with Christ as the Good Shepherd, and sheep are an element in the Christian iconography of the birth of Jesus.

 Some Christian saints are considered patrons of shepherds, and even of sheep themselves.

 Christ is also portrayed as the Sacrificial lamb of God (Agnus Dei) and Easter celebrations in Greece and Romania traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb.

 In many Christian traditions, a church leader is called the pastor, which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd.


Sheep are key symbols in fables and nursery rhymes like The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, Little Bo Peep, Baa, Baa, Black Sheep, and Mary Had a Little Lamb; novels such as George Orwell's Animal Farm and Haruki Murakami's A Wild Sheep Chase; songs such as Bach's Sheep may safely graze (Schafe konnen sicher weiden) and Pink Floyd's Sheep, and poems like William Blake's "The Lamb".


The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus or only Sus domesticus), often called swine, hog, or simply pig when there is no need to distinguish it from other pigs, is a large, even-toed ungulate.

 It is variously considered a subspecies of the wild boar or a distinct species.

 The domestic pig's head-plus-body-length ranges from 0.

9 to 1.

8 m (35 to 71 in), and the adult can weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb).

 Compared to other artiodactyls, its head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts.

 Even-toed ungulates are generally herbivorous, but the domestic pig is an omnivore, like its wild relative.


When used as livestock, domestic pigs farmed primarily for the consumption of their meat, called pork.

 The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in commercial products.

 Domestic pigs, especially miniature breeds, are often kept as pets.

Descriptionedit

Domestic pig skull

Skeleton specimen of a swine
The domestic pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip.

2 The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food, and is a very acute sense organ.

 The dental formula of adult pigs is 3.

1.

4.

33.

1.

4.

3, giving a total of 44 teeth.

 The rear teeth are adapted for crushing.

 In the male the canine teeth can form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.

2
Four hoofed toes are on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.

3
Most domestic pigs have rather a bristled sparse hair covering on their skin, although woolly-coated breeds such as the Mangalitsa exist.

4
Pigs possess both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands, although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas.

5Pigs, however, like other "hairless" mammals (e.

g.

 elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling.

6 Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting.

 Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22¢XC.

7 At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling; although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, ecto-parasite control, and scent-marking.

8
Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom.

 Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom £\-neurotoxin from binding.

 These represent four separate, independent mutations.

9
Taxonomyedit
The domestic pig is most often considered to be a subspecies of the wild boar, which was given the name Sus scrofa by Carl Linnaeus in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the domestic pig is Sus scrofa domesticus.

1011 However, in 1777, Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben classified the domestic pig as a separate species from the wild boar.

 He gave it the name Sus domesticus, which is still used by some taxonomists.

1213
Historyedit
Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000¡V12,700 BCcitation needed in the Near East in the Tigris Basin,14page needed Cayonu, Cafer Hoyuk, Neval.
 Cori15 being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans.

16 Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BC in Cyprus.

 Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then.

17 There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8000 years ago.

1819
DNA evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East.

 This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock.

 Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East.

2021 Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries.

18
In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms.

 The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported.

 The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar.

 A model that fitted the data included a mixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene.

 The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology.

 The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome.

 The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.

22 23
The adaptable nature and omnivorous diet of the wild boar allowed early humans to domesticate it readily.

 Pigs were mostly used for food, but early civilizations also used the pigs' hides for shields, bones for tools and weapons, and bristles for brushes.

24 In India, pigs have been domesticated for a long time, mostly in Goa and some rural areas, for pig toilets.

 Though ecologically logical as well as economical, pig toilets are waning in popularity as use of septic tanks and sewage systems is increasing in rural areas.


Among the animals that the Spanish introduced to the Chiloe Archipelago in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt.

 The pigs benefited from abundant shellfish and algae exposed by the large tides of the archipelago.

25 Pigs were brought to southeastern North America from Europe by de Soto and other early Spanish explorers.

 Escaped pigs became feral and caused a great deal of disruption to Native Americans, who had no domesticated animals, with the exception of dogs.

26 Feral pig populations in the southeastern United States have since migrated north and are a growing concern in the Midwest.

 Considered an invasive species, many state agencies have programs to trap or hunt feral pigs as means of removal.

272829 Domestic pigs have become feral in many other parts of the world (e.

g.

 New Zealand and northern Queensland) and have caused substantial environmental damage.

3031 Feral hybrids of the European wild boar with the domestic pig are also very disruptive to both environment and agriculture (among the 100 most damaging animal species),32 especially in southeastern South America from Uruguay to Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul (Center-West Region), and Sao Paulo (state) (Southeast Region), where they are known as javaporcos (from javali and porco, thus "boar-pigs").

3334353637
With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domesticated pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.

Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3¡V12 months of age, and come into estrus every 18¡V24 days if they are not successfully bred.

 The gestation period averages 112¡V120 days.

40 Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat.

 Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar.

 Androstenol is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response.

41 The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation.

42 Females have bicornuate uteruses and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established.

43Maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs occurs on days 11 to 12 of the pregnancy.

Behaviouredit

Domestic pigs in a wallow
In many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of carnivores and artiodactyls.

45 Domestic pigs seek out the company of other pigs, and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds.

 They typically live in groups of about 8-10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males.

46
Instinctively, pigs paw into and nudge their snouts into objects, known as ¡§rooting¡¨.

 Pigs first root when they are born in order to obtain their mother¡¦s milk; rooting is known to be found comforting.

 Most often, pigs will root and dig into the ground to forage for food.

 Rooting is known to also be used as a means of communication.

47 Because of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation.

 Wallowing, which often consists of coating the body with mud, is a behaviour frequently exhibited by pigs.

48 They do not submerge completely under the mud, but vary the depth and duration of wallowing depending on environmental conditions.

48 Typically, adult pigs start wallowing once the ambient temperature is around 17-21 ¢XC.

 On hot days, pigs cover themselves from head to toe in mud.

48 Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away.

48 Pigs will ¡§blow their coat¡¨, meaning that they shed most of the longer, more-coarse stiff hair once a year, usually in Spring or early Summer, to prepare for the warmer months ahead.

49
If conditions permit, domestic pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to ruminants which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time.

 Pigs are omnivorous, and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour.

 As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, roots, fruits and flowers.

50 Domestic pigs are highly intelligent.

5152
Nest-buildingedit
A behavioural characteristic of domestic pigs which they share with carnivores is nest-building.

 Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth.

 First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body.

 She then collects twigs, grasses and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound.

 She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet.

 When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface.

 She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material.

 She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position.

45
Nest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour.

 Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing, and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing.

53 Nest-building is divided into two phases: one of which is the initial phase of rooting in ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material.

53 The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil.

 This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation.

 The nest will provide protection against weather and predators, while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd.

 This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow.

54 Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli.

 Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour.

54 The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature.

53 The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin.


Nursing and suckling behaviouredit

 Note the greater use of the anterior teats thus forming the teat order
Compared to most other mammals, pigs display complex nursing and suckling behaviour.

55 Nursing occurs every 50¡V60 minutes, and the sow requires stimulation from piglets before milk let-down.

 Sensory inputs (vocalisation, odours from mammary and birth fluids and hair patterns of the sow) are particularly important immediately post-birth to facilitate teat location by the piglets.

56 Initially, the piglets compete for position at the udder, then each piglet massages around its respective teat with its snout, during which time the sow grunts at slow, regular intervals.

 Each series of grunts varies in frequency, tone and magnitude, indicating the stages of nursing to the piglets.

57
The phase of competition for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute, and ends when milk flow begins.

 In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats in their mouths and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), and the rate of the sow¡¦s grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds.

 The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with milk ejection, but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream.

58 Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10¡V20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second.

 The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase.

 Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow.

 The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder.

 Piglets massage and suckle the sow¡¦s teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status.

 This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings.

 The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.

59
Teat orderedit
In pigs, dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age.

 Domestic piglets are highly precocious and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle.

 The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk.

 Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.

45 Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing milk letdown,60 so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.

 Using an artificial sow to rear groups of piglets, recognition of a teat in a particular area of the udder depended initially on visual orientation by means of reference points on the udder to find the area, and then the olfactory sense for the more accurate search within that area.

61
Sensesedit
Pigs have panoramic vision of approximately 310¢X and binocular vision of 35¢X to 50¢X.

 It is thought they have no eye accommodation.

62 Other animals that have no accommodation, e.

g.

 sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects.

63 The extent to which pigs have colour vision is still a source of some debate; however, the presence of cone cells in the retina with two distinct wavelength sensitivities (blue and green) suggests that at least some colour vision is present.

64
Pigs have a well-developed sense of smell and use is made of this in Europe where they are trained to locate underground truffles.

 Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs.

65 Hearing is also well developed, and localisation of sounds is made by moving the head.

 Pigs use auditory stimuli extensively as a means of communication in all social activities.

66 Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by pheromones.

67 Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.

Breedsedit

According to The Livestock Conservancy, as of 2016, three breeds of domestic pig are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000).

 They are the Choctaw, the Mulefoot, and the Ossabaw Island pig.

When in use as livestock, the domestic pig is mostly farmed for its meat, pork.

 Other food products made from pigs include pork sausage (casings made from the intestines), bacon, gammon, ham and pork scratchings (cracklings or rinds).

 The head of a pig can be used to make a preserved jelly called head cheese (sometimes known as brawn).

 Liver, chitterlings, blood (for blood pudding or black pudding), and other offal from pigs are also widely used for food.

 In some religions, such as Judaism and Islam, pork is a taboo food.


The use of pig milk for human consumption does take place, but as there are certain difficulties in obtaining it, there is little commercial production.


Livestock pigs are exhibited at agricultural shows, judged either as stud stock compared to the standard features of each pig breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat.


Pigskin is used to produce seat covers, apparel, pork rinds, and other items.


In some developing and developed nations, the domestic pig is usually raised outdoors in yards or fields.

 In some areas, pigs are allowed to forage in woods where they may be taken care of by swineherds.

 In industrialized nations such as the United States, domestic pig farming has switched from the traditional pig farm to large-scale intensive pig farms.

 This has resulted in lower production costs, but can cause significant cruelty problems, and demand for pasture-raised pork in the United States has increased as consumers become concerned with humane treatment of livestock.

Main article: Miniature pig

Two pot-bellied pigs, a breed of domestic pig originating in Vietnam
Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs, a small breed of domestic pig, have made popular house pets in the United States beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century.



Pigs are highly intelligent animals,71 and according to David DiSalvo¡¦s writing in Forbes, they are "widely thought to be the smartest domesticated animal in the world".

72a They are considered hypoallergenic, and are known to do quite well with people who have usual animal allergies.

 Un-neutered male and female swine may exhibit unwanted, aggressive behavior, and are prone to developing serious health issues.

76 As prey animals, natural behavior may cause pigs to have a fear of being picked up, but they will usually calm down once placed back onto the ground.

 While holding the pig, supporting it under the legs is not as stressful for the animal.

77 Regular trimming of the hooves is necessary; hooves left untreated cause major pain in the pig, can create malformations in bone structure, and may cause it to be more susceptible to fungal growth between crevices of the hoof.

78


Though misleading, the term "miniature pig" refers to any small breed of pig (however, Beijing Genomics Institute in Shenzhen has since engineered actual, literal, miniature pigs, via TALEN genome editing to inactivate the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR); these are just 15 kg at maturity79).

 Large porcine (due to their size and destructive tendencies) typically need to be moved into an outdoor pen as they grow older.


In human healthcareedit

The domestic pig, both as a live animal and source of post-mortem tissues, is one of the most valuable animal models used in biomedical research today, because of its biological, physiological and anatomical similarities to human beings.

 Porcine are used in finding treatments, cures for diseases, xenotransplantation, and for general education.

 They are also used in the development of medical instruments and devices, surgical techniques and instrumentation, and FDA-approved research.

 As part of animal conservation (The Three Rs (animals)), these animals contribute to the reduction methods for animal research, as they supply more information from less animals used, for a lower cost.


Xenotransplantationedit
Main article: Xenotransplantation
Pigs are currently thought to be the best non-human candidates for organ donation to humans.

 The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.

80 They are readily available, their organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations.

81
To date, no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to obstacles arising from the response of the recipient¡¦s immune system¡Xgenerally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and in some cases result in the death of the recipient¡Xincluding hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection and chronic rejection.

 An early major breakthrough was the 1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockout.

82
Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus.

 Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes.

 The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population.

 Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.

83
Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.


The domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.


The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae.

 There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.

1 Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world.

2 In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

3
Female goats are referred to as "does" or "nannies", intact males are called "bucks" or "billies" and juveniles of both sexes are called "kids".

 Castrated males are called "wethers".

 Goat meat from younger animals is called "kid" or "cabrito" (from Spanish and/or Portuguese), while meat from older animals is known simply as "goat" or sometimes called "chevon", or, in some areas, "mutton" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).

Etymology
The Modern English word goat comes from Old English g.
t "she-goat, goat in general", which in turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf.

 Dutch/Icelandic geit, German Geis, and Gothic gaits), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *aidos meaning "young goat" (cf.

 Latin haedus "kid"),4 itself perhaps from a root meaning "jump" (assuming that Old Church Slavonic zaj.
c.
 "hare", Sanskrit jih.
te "he moves" are related).

citation needed To refer to the male, Old English used bucca (giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th century.

 Nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century and billy goat (for males) in the 19th.


History

Horn cores from the Neolithic village of Atlit Yam
Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans.

5 The most recent genetic analysis6 confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild Bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today.

5
Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel, and their bones, hair and sinew for clothing, building and tools.

1 The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran.

 Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami,7 Djeitun, and Cayonu, dating the domestication of goats in Western Asia at between 8000 and 9000 years ago.

5
Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years BP as the domestication date.

6
Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale.

 It has also been used to produce parchment.

Goats are considered small livestock animals, compared to bigger animals such as cattle, camels and horses, but larger than microlivestock such as poultry, rabbits, cavies, and bees.

 Each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 140 kg (300 lb) for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 20 to 27 kg (45 to 60 lb) for smaller goat does.

8 Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes.

 At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pygmy, which stand 41 to 58 cm (16 to 23 in) at the shoulder as adults.

9
Most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed.

 Goats have horns unless they are "polled" (meaning, genetically hornless) or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth.

10 There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited.

 The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats.

 Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked.

 Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile.

10 Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.

11
Goats are ruminants.

 They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum.

 As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates.

 The females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats.

12 An exception to this is the Boer goat, which sometimes may have up to eight teats.

131415
Goats have horizontal, slit-shaped pupils.

 Because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera.


Both male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross Boers, and pygmy goats) may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck.

16
Some breeds of sheep and goats look similar, but they can usually be told apart because goat tails are short and usually point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger ¡V though some (like those of Northern European short-tailed sheep) are short, and longer ones are often docked.


Reproduction

Goat kid

A two-month-old goat kid in a field of capeweed
Goats reach puberty between three and 15 months of age, depending on breed and nutritional status.

 Many breeders prefer to postpone breeding until the doe has reached 70% of the adult weight.

 However, this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed, open-range herds.

17
In temperate climates and among the Swiss breeds, the breeding season commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring or before.

 In equatorial regions, goats are able to breed at any time of the year.

 Successful breeding in these regions depends more on available forage than on day length.

 Does of any breed or region come into estrus (heat) every 21 days for two to 48 hours.

 A doe in heat typically flags (vigorously wags) her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat.



A female goat and two kids
Bucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the does' heat cycles.

 Bucks of equatorial breeds may show seasonal reduced fertility, but as with the does, are capable of breeding at all times.

 Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does.

 A buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his forelegs and face.

 Sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goat's odor, which is important to make him attractive to the female.

 Some does will not mate with a buck which has been descented.

18
In addition to natural, traditional mating, artificial insemination has gained popularity among goat breeders, as it allows easy access to a wide variety of bloodlines.


Gestation length is approximately 150 days.

 Twins are the usual result, with single and triplet births also common.

 Less frequent are litters of quadruplet, quintuplet, and even sextuplet kids.

 Birthing, known as kidding, generally occurs uneventfully.

 Just before kidding, the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip, as well as heavy breathing.

 She may have a worried look, become restless and display great affection for her keeper.

 The mother often eats the placenta, which gives her much-needed nutrients, helps stanch her bleeding, and parallels the behavior of wild herbivores, such as deer, to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predators.

1920
Freshening (coming into milk production) occurs at kidding.

 Milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between 680 and 1,810 kg (1,500 and 4,000 lb) of milk per 305-day lactation.

 On average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least 3 kg (6 lb) of milk per day while she is in milk.

 A first-time milker may produce less, or as much as 7 kg (16 lb), or more of milk in exceptional cases.

 After the lactation, the doe will "dry off", typically after she has been bred.

 Occasionally, goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical 305 days.

21 Meat, fiber, and petbreeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until weaning.


Male lactation is also known to occur in goats.

22
Diet
Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, including tin cans and cardboard boxes.

 While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are browsinganimals, not grazers like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and paper (such as labels from tin cans).

23 The unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes may further stimulate their curiosity.

A domestic goat feeding in a field of capeweed, a weed which is toxic to most stock animals
Aside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant.

 However, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which are otherwise toxic.

24 They will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation.

 This is one reason goat-rearing is most often free ranging, since stall-fed goat-rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.


Goats prefer to browse on vines, such as kudzu, on shrubbery and on weeds, more like deer than sheep, preferring them to grasses.

 Nightshade is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats.

 Silage (fermented corn stalks) and haylage (fermented grass hay) can be used if consumed immediately after opening ¡V goats are particularly sensitive to Listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds.

 Alfalfa, a high-protein plant, is widely fed as hay; fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay.

 Mold in a goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it.


In various places in China, goats are used in the production of tea.

 Goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves (which contain bitter tasting substances) but instead eat the weeds.

 The goats' droppings fertilise the tea plants.

25
The digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal.

 Milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling.

 At birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.


The adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed (genetic potential) and its diet while growing (nutritional potential).

 As with all livestock, increased protein diets (10 to 14%) and sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than lower protein rates and limited calories.

26Large-framed goats, with a greater skeletal size, reach mature weight at a later age (36 to 42 months) than small-framed goats (18 to 24 months) if both are fed to their full potential.

 Large-framed goats need more calories than small-framed goats for maintenance of daily functions.

27
Behavior

Goats establish a dominance hierarchy in flocks, sometimes through head butting.



An example of the goats' social behavior within a flock.



Glycerinated goat tongue
Goats are naturally curious.

 They are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious places.

 This makes them the only ruminant to regularly climb trees.

 Due to their agility and inquisitiveness, they are notorious for escaping their pens by testing fences and enclosures, either intentionally or simply because they are used to climb on.

 If any of the fencing can be overcome, goats will almost inevitably escape.

 Due to their intelligence, once a goat has discovered a weakness in the fence, they will exploit it repeatedly, and other goats will observe and quickly learn the same method.

citation needed
Goats explore anything new or unfamiliar in their surroundings, primarily with their prehensile upper lip and tongue, by nibbling at them, occasionally even eating them.


When handled as a group, goats tend to display less herding behavior than sheep.

 When grazing undisturbed, they tend to spread across the field or range, rather than feed side-by-side as do sheep.

 When nursing young, goats will leave their kids separated ("lying out") rather than clumped, as do sheep.

 They will generally turn and face an intruder and bucks are more likely to charge or butt at humans than are rams.

28
A study by Queen Mary University reports that goats try to communicate with people in the same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses.

 Goats were first domesticated as livestock more than 10,000 years ago.

 Research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered, but was then modified.

 Specifically, when presented with a box, the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside, but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed, the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them, before looking back toward the box.

 This is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets, such as dogs.

 Researchers believe that better understanding of human-goat interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals' welfare.

2930 The field of anthrozoology has established that domesticated animals have the capacity for complex communication with humans when in 2015 a Japanese scientist determined that levels of oxytocin did increase in human subjects when dogs were exposed to a dose of the "love hormone", proving that a human-animal bond does exist.

 This is the same affinity that was proven with the London study above; goats are intelligent, capable of complex communication, and able to form bonds.

31 Despite having the reputation of being slightly rebellious, more and more people today are choosing more exotic companion animals like goats.

 Goats are herd animals and typically prefer the company of other goats, but because of their herd mentality, they will follow their owners around just the same.



Goats are well known for being hard to contain with fencing

Diseases
Main article: List of infectious sheep and goat diseases
While goats are generally considered hardy animals and in many situations receive little medical care, they are subject to a number of diseases.

 Among the conditions affecting goats are respiratory diseases including pneumonia, foot rot, internal parasites, pregnancy toxosis and feed toxicity.

 Feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location.

 Certain foreign fruits and vegetables can be toxic to different breeds of goats.


Goats can become infected with various viral and bacterial diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, caprine arthritis encephalitis, caseous lymphadenitis, pinkeye, mastitis, and pseudorabies.

 They can transmit a number of zoonotic diseases to people, such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, Q-fever, and rabies.

32
Life expectancy
Life expectancy for goats is between fifteen and eighteen years.

33 An instance of a goat reaching the age of 24 has been reported.

34
Several factors can reduce this average expectancy; problems during kidding can lower a doe's expected life span to ten or eleven, and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck's expected life span to eight to ten years.

A goat is useful to humans when it is living and when it is dead, first as a renewable provider of milk, manure, and fiber, and then as meat and hide.

35 Some charities provide goats to impoverished people in poor countries, because goats are easier and cheaper to manage than cattle, and have multiple uses.

 In addition, goats are used for driving and packing purposes.


The intestine of goats is used to make "catgut", which is still in use as a material for internal human surgical sutures and strings for musical instruments.

 The horn of the goat, which signifies plenty and wellbeing (the cornucopia), is also used to make spoons.

Husbandry

Reared goat(Husbandry)
Husbandry, or animal care and use, varies by region and culture.

 The particular housing used for goats depends not only on the intended use of the goat, but also on the region of the world where they are raised.

 Historically, domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.

 These methods of herding are still used today.


In some parts of the world, especially Europe and North America, distinct breeds of goats are kept for dairy (milk) and for meat production.

 Excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat.

 Both does and bucks of meat breeds may be slaughtered for meat, as well as older animals of any breed.

 The meat of older bucks (more than one year old) is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption.

 Castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor.



For smallholder farmers in many countries, such as this woman from Burkina Faso, goats are important livestock.


Dairy goats are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter.

 As dairy does are milked daily, they are generally kept close to the milking shed.

 Their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrates.

 Stabled goats may be kept in stalls similar to horses, or in larger group pens.

 In the US system, does are generally rebred annually.

 In some European commercial dairy systems, the does are bred only twice, and are milked continuously for several years after the second kidding.


Meat goats are more frequently pastured year-round, and may be kept many miles from barns.

 Angora and other fiber breeds are also kept on pasture or range.

 Range-kept and pastured goats may be supplemented with hay or concentrates, most frequently during the winter or dry seasons.


In India, Nepal, and much of Asia, goats are kept largely for milk production, both in commercial and household settings.

 The goats in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder.

 The Salem Black goat is herded to pasture in fields and along roads during the day, but is kept penned at night for safe-keeping.

38
In Africa and the Mideast, goats are typically run in flocks with sheep.

 This maximizes the production per acre, as goats and sheep prefer different food plants.

 Multiple types of goat-raising are found in Ethiopia, where four main types have been identified: pastured in annual crop systems, in perennial crop systems, with cattle, and in arid areas, under pastoral (nomadic) herding systems.

 In all four systems, however, goats were typically kept in extensive systems, with few purchased inputs.

39 Household goats are traditionally kept in Nigeria.

 While many goats are allowed to wander the homestead or village, others are kept penned and fed in what is called a 'cut-and-carry' system.

 This type of husbandry is also used in parts of Latin America.

 Cut-and-carry, which refers to the practice of cutting down grasses, corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field, is particularly suited for types of feed, such as corn or cane, that are easily destroyed by trampling.

40
Pet goats may be found in many parts of the world when a family keeps one or more animals for emotional reasons rather than as production animals.

 It is becoming more common for goats to be kept exclusively as pets in North America and Europe.


Meat
Main article: Goat meat
See also: List of goat dishes
The taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of spring lamb meat;41 in fact, in the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, and in some parts of Asia, particularly Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, the word ¡§mutton¡¨ is used to describe both goat and lamb meat.

 However, some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison, depending on the age and condition of the goat.

 Its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of 4-methyloctanoic and 4-methylnonanoic acid.

42 It can be prepared in a variety of ways, including stewing, baking, grilling, barbecuing, canning, and frying; it can be minced, curried, or made into sausage.

 Due to its low fat content, the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional moisture.

 One of the most popular goats grown for meat is the South African Boer, introduced into the United States in the early 1990s.

 The New Zealand Kiko is also considered a meat breed, as is the myotonic or "fainting goat", a breed originating in Tennessee.


Milk, butter and cheese
See also: List of goat milk cheeses

A goat being machine milked on an organic farm
Goats produce about 2% of the world's total annual milk supply.

43 Some goats are bred specifically for milk.

 If the strong-smelling buck is not separated from the does, his scent will affect the milk.


Goat milk naturally has small, well-emulsified fat globules, which means the cream remains suspended in the milk, instead of rising to the top, as in raw cow milk; therefore, it does not need to be homogenized.

 Indeed, if the milk is to be used to make cheese, homogenization is not recommended, as this changes the structure of the milk, affecting the culture's ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheese.

 Goat cheese is known as fromage de chevre ("goat cheese") in France.

 Some varieties include Rocamadour and Montrachet.

46 Goat butter is white because goats produce milk with the yellow beta-carotene converted to a colorless form of vitamin A.

Nutrition
The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages feeding infants milk derived from goats.

 An April 2010 case report47 summarizes their recommendation and presents "a comprehensive review of the consequences associated with this dangerous practice", also stating, "Many infants are exclusively fed unmodified goat's milk as a result of cultural beliefs as well as exposure to false online information.

 Anecdotal reports have described a host of morbidities associated with that practice, including severe electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylactic shock, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and infections.

" Untreated caprine brucellosis results in a 2% case fatality rate.

 According to the USDA, doe milk is not recommended for human infants because it contains "inadequate quantities of iron, folate, vitamins C and D, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6, and pantothenic acid to meet an infant¡¦s nutritional needs" and may cause harm to an infant's kidneys and could cause metabolic damage.

48
The department of health in the United Kingdom has repeatedly released statements stating on various occasions that49 "Goats' milk is not suitable for babies, and infant formulas and follow-on formulas based on goats' milk protein have not been approved for use in Europe", and "infant milks based on goats' milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition for infants.

"50
Also according to the Canadian Federal Health Department ¡V Health Canada, most of the dangers or counter-indication of feeding unmodified goat milk to infants, are similar to those occurring in the same practice with cow's milk, namely in the allergic reactions.

51
However, some farming groups promote the practice.

 For example, Small Farm Today, in 2005, claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diets, proposing that glycerol ethers, possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants, are much higher in does' milk than in cows' milk.

52 A 1970 book on animal breeding claimed that does' milk differs from cows' or humans' milk by having higher digestibility, distinct alkalinity, higher buffering capacity, and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition.

53 George Mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to certain mammals' milk.

54 However, like cow milk, doe milk has lactose (sugar), and may cause gastrointestinal problems for individuals with lactose intolerance.

54 In fact, the level of lactose is similar to that of cow milk.

Fiber

An Angora goat
The Angora breed of goats produces long, curling, lustrous locks of mohair.

 The entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs.

 The locks constantly grow to four inches or more in length.

 Angora crossbreeds, such as the pygora and the nigora, have been created to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller, easier-to-manage animal.

 The wool is shorn twice a year, with an average yield of about 4.

5 kg (10 lb).


Most goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer guard hairs on the surface.

 The desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former, and it goes by several names (down, cashmere and pashmina).

 The coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye.

 The cashmere goat produces a commercial quantity of cashmere wool, which is one of the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced; cashmere is very fine and soft.

 The cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year, yielding around 260 g (9 oz) of down.


In South Asia, cashmere is called "pashmina" (from Persian pashmina, "fine wool").

 In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Kashmir (then called Cashmere by the British), had a thriving industry producing shawls from goat-hair imported from Tibet and Tartary through Ladakh.

 The shawls were introduced into Western Europe when the General in Chief of the French campaign in Egypt (1799¡V1802) sent one to Paris.

 Since these shawls were produced in the upper Kashmir and Ladakh region, the wool came to be known as "cashmere".


Land clearing
Goats have been used by humans to clear unwanted vegetation for centuries.

 They have been described as "eating machines" and "biological control agents".

5758There has been a resurgence of this in North America since 1990, when herds were used to clear dry brush from California hillsides thought to be endangered by potential wildfires.

 This form of using goats to clear land is sometimes known as conservation grazing.

 Since then, numerous public and private agencies have hired private herds to perform similar tasks.

57 This practice has become popular in the Pacific Northwest, where they are used to remove invasive species not easily removed by humans, including (thorned) blackberry vines and poison oak.

575960
Use for medical training
As a goat's anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of human, some countries' militaries use goats to train combat medics.

 In the United States, goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.

61 While modern mannequinsused in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, trainees feel that "the goat exercise provides a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide".

62
As pets
Main article: Goats as pets
Some people choose goats as a pet because of their ability to form close bonds with their human guardians.

 Because of goats' herd mentality, they will follow their owner around and form close bonds with them.


Breeds
Main article: List of goat breeds
Goat breeds fall into overlapping, general categories.

 They are generally distributed in those used for dairy, fiber, meat, skins, and as companion animals.

 Some breeds are also particularly noted as pack goats.


Showing

A Nigerian Dwarf milker in show clip.

 This doe is angular and dairy with a capacious and well supported mammary system.


Goat breeders' clubs frequently hold shows, where goats are judged on traits relating to conformation, udder quality, evidence of high production, longevity, build and muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production and the fiber itself (fiber goats).

 People who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award-winning animals command a higher price.

 Registered goats, in general, are usually higher-priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors.

 A registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder.

 Children's clubs such as 4-H also allow goats to be shown.

 Children's shows often include a showmanship class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are scored.

 In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged.


Various "Dairy Goat Scorecards" (milking does) are systems used for judging shows in the US.

 The American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA) scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major categories that include general appearance, the dairy character of a doe (physical traits that aid and increase milk production), body capacity, and specifically for the mammary system.

 Young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character.


The American Goat Society (AGS) has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows.

 The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards.

 The "Angora Goat scorecard" used by the Colored Angora Goat Breeder's Association (CAGBA), which covers the white and the colored goats, includes evaluation of an animal's fleece color, density, uniformity, fineness, and general body confirmation.

 Disqualifications include: a deformed mouth, broken down pasterns, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3 inch split in scrotum, and close-set or distorted horns.

Feral goats
Main article: Feral goat

Feral goat in Aruba
Goats readily revert to the wild (become feral) if given the opportunity.

 The only domestic animal known to return to feral life as swiftly is the cat.

5 Feral goats have established themselves in many areas: they occur in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, the Galapagos and in many other places.

 When feral goats reach large populations in habitats which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predators or which are otherwise vulnerable to goats' aggressive grazing habits, they may have serious effects, such as removing native scrub, trees and other vegetation which is required by a wide range of other creatures, not just other grazing or browsing animals.

 Feral goats are common in Australia.

67 However, in other circumstances where predator pressure is maintained, they may be accommodated into some balance in the local food web.


The dromedary (/.
dr.
m.
d.
ri/ or /-.
dri/), also called the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius), is a large, even-toed ungulatewith one hump on its back.

 The dromedary is the smallest of the three species of camel; adult males stand 1.

8¡V2 m (5.

9¡V6.

6 ft) at the shoulder, while females are 1.

7¡V1.

9 m (5.

6¡V6.

2 ft) tall.

 Males typically weigh between 400 and 600 kg (880 and 1,320 lb), and females weigh between 300 and 540 kg (660 and 1,190 lb).

 The species' distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump (compared with two on the Bactrian camel and wild Bactrian camel), and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump.

 The coat is generally a shade of brown.

 The hump, 20 cm (7.

9 in) tall or more, is made of fat bound together by fibrous tissue.


Dromedaries are mainly active during daylight hours.

 They form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a dominantmale.

 This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat.

 Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.


The dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years.

 It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago.

 In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert.

 The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia.

 Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.

Etymologyedit
The common name "dromedary" comes from the Old French dromedaire or the Late Latin dromedarius.

 These originated from the Greek word dromas, £_£l£j£g (£j, £b) (GEN (£^£`£h£d£e.
) dromados, £_£l£j£g.
£_£j.
), meaning "running" or "runner",23 used in Greek in the combination £_£l£j£g £e.
£g£b£f£j.
 (dromas kamelos), literally "running camel", to refer to the dromedary.

24 The first recorded use in English of the name "dromedary" occurred in the 14th century.

5 The dromedary possibly originated in Arabia and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Arabian camel.

6 The word "camel" generally refers either to the dromedary or the congeneric Bactrian; it may have been derived from the Latin word camelus, the Greek kam.
los,7 or an old Semitic language such as the Hebrew g.

The dromedary shares the genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C.

 bactrianus) and the wild Bactrian camel (C.

 ferus).

 The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae.

110 The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) was the first to describe the species of Camelus.

 He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel.

1112 The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae.

13 In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type ¡V slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.


In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues carried out a phylogenetic study of the evolutionary relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini ¡V consisting of the three Camelusspecies (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) ¡V and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L.

 glama) and the vicuna (V.

 vicugna).

 The study showed the two tribes had diverged25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.


The dromedary and the Bactrian camel often interbreed to produce fertile offspring.

 Where the ranges of the species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding.

 The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties.

14 However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome bgene showed the species display 10.

3% divergence in their sequences.

Genetics and hybridsedit
Main article: Hybrid camel
The dromedary has 74 diploid chromosomes, the same as other camelids.

 The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics.

16 The X chromosome is the largest in the metacentric and submetacentric group.

17 There are 31 pairs of acrocentrics.

16 The dromedary's karyotype is similar to that of the Bactrian camel.

18
Camel hybridisation began in the first millennium BC.

19 For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps ¡V one small and one large.

 These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents ¡V they can bear greater loads.

1719 A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid.

 Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.

20
Evolutionedit
The extinct Protylopus, which occurred in North America during the upper Eocene, is the oldest and the smallest-known camel.

21 During the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene, several mammals faced extinction.

 This period marked the successful radiation of the Camelus species, which migrated over the Bering Strait and dispersed widely into Asia, eastern Europe and Africa.

2223 By the Pleistocene, ancestors of the dromedary occurred in the Middle East and northern Africa.

24
The modern dromedary probably evolved in the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was closely related to the earliest Old World camels.

23 This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the dromedary foetus has two humps, while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present.

14 A jawbone of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.

625
In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University wrote that the dromedary exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent.

 He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but did not have to depend upon its products.

26
Characteristicsedit

Note the thick, double-layered eyelashes and bushy eyebrows on the head of this camel in Algeria

Note the long curved neck, single hump and the long hair on the throat, shoulders and hump of the dromedary
The dromedary is the largest camel after the Bactrian camel.

 Adult males range in height between 1.

8 and 2 m (5.

9 and 6.

6 ft) at the shoulder; females range between 1.

7 and 1.

9 m (5.

6 and 6.

2 ft).

 Males typically weigh between 400 and 600 kg (880 and 1,320 lb); females range between 300 and 540 kg (660 and 1,190 lb).

 The distinctive features are its long, curved neck, narrow chest and single hump (the Bactrian camel has two), thick, double-layered eyelashes and bushy eyebrows.

17 They have sharp vision and a good sense of smell.

6 The male has a soft palate (dulaa in Arabic) nearly 18 cm (7.

1 in) long, which it inflates to produce a deep pink sac.

 The palate, which is often mistaken for the tongue, dangles from one side of the mouth and is used to attract females during the mating season.

27
The coat is generally brown but can range from black to nearly white.

17 Leese reported piebald dromedaries in Kordofan and Darfur in Sudan.

28 The hair is long and concentrated on the throat, shoulders and the hump.

 The large eyes are protected by prominent supraorbital ridges; the ears are small and rounded.

 The hump is at least 20 cm (7.

9 in) high.

17 The dromedary has long, powerful legs with two toes on each foot.

 The feet resemble flat, leathery pads.

29 Like the giraffe, dromedaries moves both legs on one side of the body at the same time.

30
Compared with the Bactrian camel, the dromedary has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure.

31Unlike the camelids of the genus Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder.

 The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.

17
Anatomyedit

Skeleton

Body for comparison with skeleton

Dromedary heart
The cranium of the dromedary consists of a postorbital bar, a tympanic bulla filled with spongiosa, a well-defined sagittal crest, a long facial part and an indented nasal bone.

32 Typically, there are eight sternal and four non-sternal pairs of ribs.

28 The spinal cord is nearly 214 cm (84 in) long; it terminates in the second and third sacral vertebra.

33 The fibula is reduced to a malleolar bone.

 The dromedary is a digitigrade animal; it walks on its toes, which are known as digits.

 It lacks the second and fifth digits.

34 The front feet are 19 cm (7.

5 in) wide and 18 cm (7.

1 in) long; they are larger than the hind feet, which measure 17 cm (6.

7 in) wide and 16 cm (6.

3 in) long.

29
The dromedary has 22 milk teeth, which are eventually replaced by 34 permanent teeth.

5 to 6.

5 years of age.

 All teeth are in use by 8 years.

36 The lenses of the eyes contain crystallin, which constitutes 8 to 13% of the protein present there.

38 The hump is composed of fat bound together by fibrous tissue.

17 There are no glands on the face; males have glands that appear to be modified apocrine sweat glands that secrete pungent, coffee-coloured fluid during the rut, located on either side of the neck midline.

 The glands generally grow heavier during the rut, and range from 20 to 115 g (0.

71 to 4.

06 oz).

39 Each cover hair is associated with an arrector pilli muscle, a hair follicle, a ring of sebaceous glands and a sweat gland.

2740 Females have cone-shaped, four-chambered mammary glands that are 2.

4 cm (0.

94 in) long with a base diameter of 1.

5 cm (0.

59 in).

41 These glands can produce milk with up to 90% water content even if the mother is at risk of dehydration.

17

Camel kidney (longitudinal cut)
The heart weighs around 5 kg (11 lb); it has two ventricles with the tip curving to the left.

 The pulse rate is 50 beats per minute.

42The dromedary is the only mammal with oval red blood corpuscles.

43 The pH of the blood varies from 7.

1 to 7.

6 (slightly alkaline).

 The individual's state of hydration and sex, and the time of year can influence blood values.

44 The lungs lack lobes.

28 A dehydrated camel has a lower breathing rate.

45 Each kidney has a capacity of 858 cm3 (52.

4 cu in), and can produce urine with high chloride concentrations.

 Like the horse, the dromedary has no gall bladder.

 The grayish violet, crescent-like spleen weighs less than 500 g (18 oz).

43 The triangular, four-chambered liver weighs 6.

35 The placenta is diffuse and epitheliochorial, with a crescent-like chorion.

47
The penis is covered by a triangular penile sheath that opens backwards; it is about 60 cm (24 in) long.

48 The scrotum is located high in the perineum with the testicles in separate sacs.

 Testicles are 7¡V10 cm (2.

8¡V3.

17 The right testicle is often smaller than the left.

14 The typical mass of either testicle is less than 140 g (0.

31 lb); during the rut the mass increases from 165 to 253 g (0.

364 to 0.

558 lb).

17 The Cowper's gland is white, almond-shaped and lacks seminal vesicles; the prostate glandis dark yellow, disc-shaped and divided into two lobes.

48
Health and diseasesedit

3D image of MERS-CoV, of which the dromedary is possibly the animal source
The dromedary generally suffers from fewer diseases than other domestic livestock such as goats and cattle.

49 Temperature fluctuations occur throughout the day in a healthy dromedary ¡V the temperature falls to its minimum at dawn, rises until sunset and falls during the night.

50 Nervous camels may vomit if they are carelessly handled; this does not always indicate a disorder.

 Rutting males may develop nausea.

14
The dromedary is prone to trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly.

 The main symptoms are recurring fever, anaemia and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel.

51 Brucellosis is another prominent malady.

 In an observational study, the seroprevalence of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations.

 Brucellosis is caused by different biotypes of Brucella abortus and B.

 melitensis.

52 Other internal parasites include Fasciola gigantica (trematode), two types of cestode (tapeworm) and various nematodes (roundworms).

 Among external parasites, Sarcoptes species cause sarcoptic mange.

17 In a 2000 study in Jordan, 83% of the 32 camels studied tested positive for sarcoptic mange.

53 In another study, dromedaries were found to have natural antibodies against the rinderpest and ovine rinderpestviruses.

54
In 2013, a seroepidemiological study (a study investigating the patterns, causes and effects of a disease on a specific population on the basis of serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

55 A 2013¡V14 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus.

 The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.

9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV.

56 Another study in Saudi Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.

57
Fleas and ticks are common causes of physical irritation.

 In a study in Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.

6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels.

 In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105.

 Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations.

58 Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compressionand nervous disorders.

 Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrixand deficiency of salt in the diet.

17
Ecologyedit

Herd of dromedaries in Israel

The dromedary's relationships with the lion and mankind is depicted in this taxidermy diorama by Jules and Edouard Verreaux, which is called "Lion Attacking a Dromedary," and was acquired by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, in 1898.

59
The dromedary is diurnal (active mainly during daylight); free-ranging herds feed and roam throughout the day, though they rest during the hottest hours around noon.

 The night is mainly spent resting.

 Dromedaries form cohesive groups of about 20 individuals, which consist of several females led by a dominant male.

 Females may also lead in turns.

17 Some males either form bachelor groups or roam alone.

60Herds may congregate to form associations of hundreds of camels during migrations at the time of natural disasters.

 The males of the herd prevent female members from interacting with bachelor males by standing or walking between them and sometimes driving the bachelor males away.

 In Australia, short-term home ranges of feral dromedaries cover 50 to 150 km2 (19 to 58 sq mi); annual home ranges can spread over several thousand square kilometres.

17
Special behavioral features of the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet.

 They are generally non-aggressive, with the exception of rutting males.

 They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring.

17 Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle.

 A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour.

 Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs.

61 Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors.

 They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.

17
Free-ranging dromedaries face large predators typical of their regional distribution, which includes wolves, lions59 and tigers.

29
Dietedit

Dromedaries are primarily browsers
The dromedary's diet consists mostly of foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation ¡V mostly thorny plants.

62 A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.

5%), trees (29.

9%), grasses (11.

2%), other herbs (0.

2%) and vines (11%).

63The dromedary is primarily a browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter.

 The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.

64
In the Sahara, 332 plant species have been recorded as food plants of the dromedary.

 These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca.

29 The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available.

64 Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis.

 In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V.

 mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris.

64 Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food.

 They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times.

 Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding.

62 They graze for 8¡V12 hours per day and ruminate for an equal amount of time.

17
Adaptationsedit

Footprint in dry sand
The dromedary is specially adapted to its desert habitat; these adaptations are aimed at conserving water and regulating body temperature.

 The bushy eyebrows and the double row of eyelashes prevent sand and dust from entering the eyes during strong windstorms, and shield them from the sun's glare.

65 The dromedary is able to close its nostrils voluntarily; this assists in water conservation.

59 The dromedary can conserve water by reducing perspiration by fluctuating the body temperature throughout the day from 31 to 41.

7 ¢XC (87.

8 to 107.

1 ¢XF).

 The kidneys are specialised to minimise water loss through excretion.

 Groups of camels avoid excess heat from the environment by pressing against each other.

 The dromedary can tolerate greater than 30% water loss, which is generally impossible for other mammals.

 In temperatures between 30 and 40 ¢XC (86 and 104 ¢XF), it needs water every 10 to 15 days.

 In the hottest temperatures the dromedary takes water every four to seven days.

 This camel has a quick rate of rehydration and can drink at 10¡V20 L (2.

2¡V4.

4 imp gal) per minute.

17 The dromedary has a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which uses countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain.

 This effectively controls the temperature of the brain.

66
The hump stores up to 80 lb (36 kg) of fat, which the camel can break down into water and energy to meet its needs when resources are scarce; the hump also helps dissipate body heat.

67 If the hump is small, the animal can show signs of starvation.

 In a 2005 study, the mean volume of adipose tissues (in the external part of the hump that have cells to store lipids) is related to the dromedary's unique mechanism of food and water storage.

68 In case of starvation, they can even eat fish and bones, and drink brackish and salty water.

6 The hair is longer on the throat, hump and shoulders.

 Though the padded hooves effectively support the camel's weight on the ground,69 they are not suitable for walking on slippery and muddy surfaces.

17
Reproductionedit

Mating

Calf suckling
Since camels have a slow growth rate;70 they reach sexual maturity only in advanced years.

 The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and depends on the individual, as does the reproductive period.

 Both sexes might mature by three to five years of age, though successful breeding could take longer.

 Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season.

 The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.

1471
During the reproductive season, males splash their urine on their tails and nether regions.

 To attract females they extrude their soft palate ¡V a trait unique to the dromedary.

72 As the male gurgles, copious quantities of saliva turns to foam and covers the mouth.

 Males threaten each other for dominance over the female by trying to stand taller than the other, making low noises and a series of head movements including lowering, lifting and bending their necks backwards.

 Males tries to defeat other males by biting the opponent's legs and taking the head between his jaws.

39 Copulation begins with foreplay; the male smells the female's genitalia and often bites her there or around her hump.

73 The male forces the female to sit, then grasps her with his forelegs.

 Camelmen often aid the male insert his penis into the female's vulva.

74 The male dromedary's ability to penetrate the female on his own is disputed, though feral populations in Australia reproduce naturally.

14 Copulation takes from 7 to 35 minutes, averaging 11 to 15 minutes.

 Normally, three to four ejaculations occur.

14 The semen of a Bikaneri dromedary is white and viscous, with a pH of around 7.

8.

73
A single calf is born after a gestation period of 15 months.

 Calves move freely by the end of their first day.

 Nursing and maternal care continue for one to two years.

 In a study to find whether young could exist on milk substitutes, two male, month-old camels were separated from their mothers and were fed on milk substitutes prepared commercially for lambs.

 For the first 30 days, the changes in their weights were marked.

 Each gained 0.

400 kg (0.

88 lb) and 1 kg (2.

2 lb), respectively, per day.

 They were found to have grown properly and weighed 135 kg (298 lb) and 145 kg (320 lb) ¡V normal weights for male calves of that age.

75 Lactational yield can vary with species, breed, individual, region, diet, management conditions and lactating stage.

76 The largest quantity of milk is produced during the early period of lactation.

14 The lactation period can vary between nine and eighteen months.

77
Dromedaries are induced ovulators.

78 Oestrus may be cued by the nutritional status of the camel and the daylength.

79 If mating does not occur, the follicle, which grows during oestrus, usually regresses within a few days.

80 In one study, 35 complete oestrous cycles were observed in five nonpregnant females over 15 months.

 The cycles were about 28 days long; follicles matured in six days, maintained their size for 13 days, and returned to their original size in eight days.

81 In another study, ovulation could be best induced when the follicle reaches a size of 0.

9¡V1.

9 cm (0.

35¡V0.

75 in).

82 In another study, pregnancy in females could be recognized as early as 40 to 45 days of gestation by the swelling of the left uterine horn, where 99.

5% of pregnancies were located.

83
Distributionedit

Domesticated dromedary camels at the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt
The dromedary has not occurred in the wild for nearly 2,000 years.

 Wild dromedaries inhabited arid regions, particularly the Sahara Desert.

 The original range of the camel's wild ancestors was probably southern Asia and the Arabian peninsula.

 Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East and western and central Asia.

84 The dromedary typically thrives in areas with a long dry season and a short wet season.

85 They are sensitive to cold and humidity,35 though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.

85
In the early 21st century, the domesticated dromedary is found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World.

85 Africa has more than 80% of the world's total dromedary population; it occurs in almost every desert zone in the northern part of the continent.

 The Sahel marks the southern extreme of its range, where the annual rainfall is around 550 mm (22 in).

 The Horn of Africa has nearly 35% of the world's dromedaries,85 most of the region's stock is in Somalia, followed by Sudan and Ethiopia (as of the early 2000s).

86 According to the Yearbook of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) for 1984, eastern Africa had about 10 million dromedaries, the largest population of Africa.

 Western Africa followed with 2.

14 million, while northern Africa had nearly 0.

76 million.

87Populations in Africa increased by 16% from 1994 to 2005.

8688

A pair of camels and calf in Israel
Feral dromedary populations occur in Australia, where it was introduced in 1840.

89 The total dromedary population in Australia is 0.

5 million as of 2005.

 Nearly 99% of the populations are feral, and have annual growth rate of 10%.

86 Most of the Australian feral camels are dromedaries, with only a few Bactrian camels.

 Most of the dromedaries occur in Western Australia, with smaller populations in the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and northern South Australia.

86
In Asia, nearly 70% of the population occurs in India and Pakistan.

 The combined population of the dromedary and the Bactrian camel decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004.

90 The dromedary is sympatric with the Bactrian camel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia.

91 India has a dromedary population of less than one million, with most (0.

67 million) in the state of Rajasthan.

86 Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.

1 million in 1994 to 0.

8 million in 2005 ¡V a 29% decline.

90 According to the FAO, the dromedary population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.

67 million in 2003.

 In the Persian Gulf region the dromedary is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour.

 The UAE has three prominent breeds; Racing camel, Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.

The dromedary was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago.

93 In the ninth or tenth century BC, the dromedary became popular in the Near East.

 The Persian invasion of Egypt under Cambyses in 525 BC introduced domesticated camels to the area.

 The Persian camels were not well-suited to trading or travel over the Sahara; journeys across the desert were made on chariots pulled by horses.

9495 The dromedary was introduced into Egypt from south-western Asia (Arabia and Persia).

5196 The popularity of dromedaries increased after the Islamic conquest of North Africa.

 While the invasion was accomplished largely on horseback, new links to the Middle East allowed camels to be imported en masse.

 These camels were well-suited to long desert journeys and could carry a great deal of cargo, allowing substantial trans-Saharan trade for the first time.

9798 In Libya, dromedaries were used for transport and their milk and meat constituted the local diet.

99
Dromedaries were also shipped from south-western Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia.

14 Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD.

100 Camels were exported to the Canary Islands in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, and are still extant there, especially in Lanzarote and to the south of Fuerteventura.

100 Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.

28
In 1840, about six camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, but only one survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year.

 The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the explorer John Ainsworth Horrocks.

 Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads.

 The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported.

 These were used mainly for riding and transport.

Relationship with humansedit
The strength and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal.

14 According to Richard Bulliet, they can be used for a wide variety of purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather.

26The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival.

 It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.

Although the role of the camel is diminishing with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas.

 The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC,104 and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world.

14 Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.

28
The ideal riding camel is strong, slender and long-legged with thin, supple skin.

 The special adaptations of the dromedary's feet allow it to walk with ease on sandy and rough terrain and on cold surfaces.

105 The camels of the Bejas of Sudan96 and the Anafi camel bred in Sudan are common breeds used as riding camels.

14
According to Leese, the dromedary walks with four speeds or gaits: walk, jog, fast run and canter.

 The first is the typical speed of walking, around 4 km/h (2.

5 mph).

 Jog is the most common speed, nearly 8¡V12 km/h (5.

0¡V7.

5 mph) on level ground.

 He estimated a speed of 14¡V19 km/h (8.

7¡V11.

8 mph) during a fast run, by observing northern African and Arabian dromedaries.

 He gave no speed range to describe the "canter", but implied it was a type of gallop that if induced could exhaust the camel and the rider.

 Canter could be used only for short periods of time, for example in races.

106
The ideal age to start training dromedaries for riding is three years,39 although they may be stubborn and unruly.

107 At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting.

28 At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it.

14 The next stage involves training it to respond to reins.

 The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads before the age of six.

28 Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider.

39 Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.

28
Baggage and draught camelsedit
The baggage camel should be robust and heavy.

 Studies have recommended the camel should have either a small or a large head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips.

 The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high.

 The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle.

 The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy.

108 The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage from the age of five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six.

109 The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan.

108 The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.

14
Draught camel are used for several purposes including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts.

 There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators.

14 It may be used for ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks.

28 The draught camel can plough at around 2.

5 km/h (1.

6 mph), and should not be used for more than six hours a day ¡V four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon.

107 The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.

Dromedary being milked in Niger
Camel milk is a staple food of nomadic tribes living in deserts.

 According to a study, it consists of 11.

7% solids, 3% protein, 3.

6% fat, 0.

8% ash, 4.

4% lactose and 0.

13% acidity (pH 6.

5).

 The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk.

 However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk.

 The molarpercentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.

7% for palmitic acid, 25.

5% oleic acid, 11.

4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid.

110 Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk,111 but it does not compare favourably with sheep milk.

14
Daily milk yield generally varies from 3.

5 to 35 kg (7.

7 to 77.

2 lb) and from 1.

3% to 7.

8% of the body weight.

112 Milk yield varies geographically and depends upon the animals' diet and living conditions.

14 At the peak of lactation, a healthy female would typically provide 9 kg (20 lb) milk per day.

23 Leese estimated a lactating female would yield 4 to 9 L (0.

88 to 1.

98 imp gal) besides the amount ingested by the calf.

28 The Pakistani dromedary, which is considered a better milker and bigger, can yield 9.

1¡V14.

1 kg (20¡V31 lb) when well-fed.

113 Dromedaries in Somalia may be milked between two and four times a day,77 while those in Afar, Ethiopia, may be milked up to seven times a day.

114
The acidity of dromedary milk stored at 30 ¢XC (86 ¢XF) increases at a slower rate than that of cow milk.

17 Though the preparation of butter from dromedary milk is difficult, it has been carried out successfully in 1959 in the USSR.

 The cream of the dromedary milk, containing 4.

2% fat, yielded 25.

8% butter.

115 In 2001, the ability of dromedary milk to form curd was studied; coagulation did not show curd formation, and had a pH of 4.

4.

 It was much different from curd produced from cow milk, and had a fragile, heterogeneous composition probably composed of casein flakes.

116 Nevertheless, cheese and other dairy products can be made from camel milk.

 A study found bovine calf rennet could be used to coagulate dromedary milk.

117 A special factory has been set up in Nouakchott to pasteurise and make cheese from camel milk.

118 Mystical beliefs surround the use of camel milk in some places; for example, it may be used as an aphrodisiac in Ethiopia.

Meat of dromedary served as food
The meat of a five-year-old dromedary has a typical composition of 76% water, 22% protein, 1% fat, and 1% ash.

79 The carcass, weighing 141¡V310 kg (311¡V683 lb) for a five-year-old dromedary,79 is composed of nearly 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat.

120 A seven-to-eight-year-old camel can produce a carcass of 125¡V400 kg (276¡V882 lb).

 The meat is bright red to a dark brown or maroon, while the fat is white.

 It has the taste and texture of beef.

120 A study of the meat of Iranian dromedaries showed its high glycogen content, which makes it taste sweet like horse meat.

 The carcasses of well-fed camels were found to be covered with a thin layer of good quality fat.

121 In a study of the fatty acid composition of raw meat taken from the hind legs of seven one-to-three years old males, 51.

5% of the fatty acids were saturated, 29.

Camel slaughter in Mauritania
Dromedary slaughter is more difficult than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, because of the size of the animal and the significant manual work involved.

 More males than females are slaughtered.

123 Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump.

124 The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered.

123 The dressing percentage ¡V the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass ¡V is 55¡V70%,79 more than the 45¡V50% of cattle.

14 Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals.

14 Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma.

120 Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age.

 As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.

14
A 2005 report issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of bubonic plague in humans resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver.

 Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis.

 Yersinia pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's corral.

125
Camel hair, wool and hidesedit
Camels in hot climates generally do not develop long coats.

 Camel hair is light, and has low thermal conductivity and durability, and is thus suitable for manufacturing warm clothes, blankets, tents and rugs.

14 Hair of highest quality is typically obtained from juvenile or wild camels.

39 In India, camels are clipped usually in spring and around 1¡V1.

5 kg (2.

2¡V3.

3 lb) hair is produced per clipping.

 In colder regions one clipping can yield as much as 5.

4 kg (12 lb).

39107 A dromedary can produce 1 kg (2.

2 lb) wool per year, whereas a Bactrian camel has an annual yield of nearly 5¡V12 kg (11¡V26 lb).

49 Dromedaries under the age of two years have a fine undercoat that tends to fall off and should be cropped by hand.

114 Little information about camel hides has been collected but they are usually of inferior quality and are less preferred for manufacturing leather.


The western honey bee or European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the most common of the 7¡V12 species of honey beeworldwide.

23 The genus name Apis is Latin for "bee", and mellifera is the Latin for "honey-bearing", referring to the species' production of honey for the winter.


Like all honey bees, the western honey bee is eusocial, creating colonies with a single fertile female (or "queen"), many sterile females or "workers," and small proportion of fertile males or "drones.

" Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees.

 Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals, through both pheromones and the dance language.


The western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects, and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities.

 With human assistance, the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica.

 Because of its wide cultivation, this species is the single most important pollinator for agriculture globally.

 Honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases, especially the varroa mite and colony collapse disorder.


Western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies, particularly in the fields of social evolution, learning, and memory; they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity, to assess non-target impacts of commercial pesticides.

Distribution and habitatedit

Global distribution
The western honey bee can be found on every continent except Antarctica.

 The species is believed to have originated in Africa4 or Asia,5 from where it spread throughout Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

 Humans are responsible for its considerable additional range, introducing European subspecies into North America (early 1600s),6 South America, Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia.

7
Western honey bees adapted to the local environments as they spread geographically.

4 These adaptations include synchronizing colony cycles to the timing of local flower resources, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, and enhanced foraging behavior in desert areas.

 All together, these variations resulted in 28 recognized subspecies,2 all of which are cross-fertile.

 The subspecies are divided into four major branches, based on work by Ruttner and confirmed by mitochondrial DNA analysis.

 African subspecies belong to branch A, northwestern European subspecies branch M, southwestern European subspecies branch C and Middle-Eastern subspecies branch O.

Main article: Honey bee life cycle
Colony life cycleedit

A bee swarm.

 Bees are non-aggressive in this state, since they have no hive to protect.


Unlike most other bee species, honey bees have perennial colonies which persist year after year.

 Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, honey bee colonies can be considered superorganisms, meaning that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit.

 Honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called "swarming".


In most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen.

 In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens.

 Just as the pupal stages of these "daughter queens" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.

g.

, a hollow tree trunk).

 In the old colony, the daughter queens often start "piping", just prior to emerging as adults,8 and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then become the new queen.

 If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.


Once she has dispatched her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile female, lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left.

 Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of haplodiploidy).

 However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time.

 Thus, the new queen goes on one or more nuptial flights, each time mating with 1¡V17 drones.

9 Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.


Throughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar to prepare for winter; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees.

 Nectar from flowers is processed by worker bees, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into honey, which can then be capped over with wax and stored almost indefinitely.

 In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive to wait out the winter, during which the queen may stop laying.

 During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey for energy to stay warm.

 In mid- to late winter, the queen starts laying again in preparation for spring (this is probably triggered by day length).

 Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and thus swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.


Individual bee life cycleedit

Larvae (left) and eggs (right)
Like other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupaand adult.

 The complex social structure of honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year.

 The queen deposits a single egg into each cell prepared by worker bees.

 The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by "nurse" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony).

 After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage.

 After another week, it emerges as an adult bee.

 It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called "brood"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.


Worker bees secrete the wax used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen, and the nature of the worker's role varies with age.

 For the first ten days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae.

 After this, they begin building comb cells.

 On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it.

 After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager.

 Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed they may lay fertile eggs.

 Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with drones and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.


Queens and workers have a modified ovipositor, a stinger, with which they defend the hive.

 Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species the stinger of worker honey bees is barbed.

 Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a human or other mammal.

 The stinger and its venom sac, with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering venom after they are detached, are designed to pull free of the body when they lodge.

 This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material.

 The barbs do not always "catch", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).


Although the average lifespan of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the German-European black bee subspecies previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years.

10 Because a queen's store of sperm is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.


The lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters.

 Workers born in spring and summer will work hard, living only a few weeks, but those born in autumn will remain inside for several months as the colony clusters.

 On average during the year, about one percent of a colony's worker bees die naturally per day.

11 Except for the queen, all of a colony's workers are replaced about every four months.


Social casteedit
Behavioral and physiological differences between castes and subcastes arise from phenotypic plasticity, which relies on gene expression rather than heritable genotypic differences.

1213
Queensedit
Main article: Queen bee
The queen bee is a fertile female, who, unlike workers (which are genetically also female), has a fully developed reproductive tract.

 She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen.

 A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee.

 Workers and queens are both fed royal jelly, which is high in protein and low in flavanoids, during the first three days of their larval stage.

 Workers are then switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called "bee bread"), while queens will continue to receive royal jelly.

 In the absence of flavanoids and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract14¡Xa task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.


Periodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed.

 There are three general causes:
1.
	The hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs.

2.
	 This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.

3.
	
4.
	The old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in queen pheromones throughout the hive.

5.
	 This is known as supersedure, and at the end of the supersedure the old queen is generally killed.

6.
	
7.
	The old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure.

8.
	 The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and attempt to develop them into queens.

9.
	 Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.

10.
	
Regardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.



Peanut-like queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb
Queens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb.

 A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically.

 If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) made from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb.

 When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell.

 At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell.

 The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones known as queen scent.


After several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point ¡V a site near a clearing and generally about 30 feet (9.

1 m) above the ground ¡V where drones from different hives congregate.

 They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with "dummy" queens with the queen pheromone.

 A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her spermatheca is full.


The queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony.

 The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics.

 Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter.

 Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring.

 At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).


She fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell.

 Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.


Workersedit
Workers are sterile females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, diploid eggs.

 Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning.

 They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing.

 These females will raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony.

 They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.


Dronesedit

Development of a drone pupa

Pupae of drones
Main article: Drone (bee)
Drones are the colony's male bees.

 Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers.

 Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen.

 The primary purpose of a drone is to fertilize a new queen.

 Many drones will mate with a given queen in flight; each will die immediately after mating, since the process of insemination requires a lethally convulsive effort.

 Drone honey bees are haploid (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen).

 In temperate regions drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves.

 There has been research into the role A.

 melliferadrones play in thermoregulation within the hive.

 Given their larger size (1.

5x), drones may play a significant role.

 Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons.

 It is postulated that it is to maintain sperm viability, which drops off at cooler temperatures.

 Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below 25 ¢XC their ability to contribute declines.

Queen-worker conflictedit
Main article: Worker policing
When a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen.

 The worker shares half her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen.

 The queen shares half her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of fertile female workers.

16 This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them.

 This relationship leads to a phenomenon known as "worker policing".

 In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queen's sons than those of the fertile workers will patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs.

 Another form of worker-based policing is aggression toward fertile females.

17 Some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker- and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior.

1819 Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen's offspring maximized.


In very rare instances workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive, laying eggs which are removed at a lower rate by other workers; this is known as anarchic syndrome.

 Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive.

 Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother would increase.

 Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive.

20
Under ordinary circumstances the death (or removal) of a queen increases reproduction in workers, and a significant proportion of workers will have active ovaries in the absence of a queen.

 The workers of the hive produce a last batch of drones before the hive eventually collapses.

 Although during this period worker policing is usually absent, in certain groups of bees it continues.

21
According to the strategy of kin selection, worker policing is not favored if a queen does not mate multiple times.

 Workers would be related by three-quarters of their genes, and the difference in relationship between sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease.

 The benefit of policing is negated, and policing is less favored.

 Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera.

Thermoregulationedit

foraging honey bee
The honey bee needs an internal body temperature of 35 ¢XC (95 ¢XF) to fly; this temperature is maintained in the nest to develop the brood, and is the optimal temperature for the creation of wax.

 The temperature on the periphery of the cluster varies with outside air temperature, and the winter cluster's internal temperature may be as low as 20¡V22 ¢XC (68¡V72 ¢XF).


Honey bees can forage over a 30 ¢XC (86 ¢XF) air-temperature range because of behavioral and physiological mechanisms for regulating the temperature of their flight muscles.

 From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight, and stopping flight for additional shivering; passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and evaporative coolingfrom regurgitated honey-sac contents.

 Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.

23
The optimal air temperature for foraging is 22¡V25 ¢XC (72¡V77 ¢XF).

 During flight, the bee's relatively large flight muscles create heat which must dissipate.

 The honey bee uses evaporative cooling to release heat through its mouth.

 Under hot conditions, heat from the thorax is dissipated through the head; the bee regurgitates a droplet of warm internal fluid ¡X a "honeycrop droplet" ¡V which reduces the temperature of its head by 10 ¢XC (18 ¢XF).

24
Below 7¡V10 ¢XC (45¡V50 ¢XF) bees are immobile, and above 38 ¢XC (100 ¢XF) their activity slows.

 Honey bees can tolerate temperatures up to 50 ¢XC (122 ¢XF) for short periods.


Communicationedit
Main article: Bee learning and communication

A large honey-bee swarm on a fallen tree trunk
Honey-bee behavior has been extensively studied, since bees are widespread and familiar.

 Karl von Frisch, who received the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his study of honey-bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance.

 Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive.

25 Honey bees direct other bees to food sources with the round dance and the waggle dance.

 Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within 50 metres (160 ft) of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction.

 The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source.

 Foragers are also thought to rely on their olfactory sense to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances.

 Unlike A.

 mellifera, Apis florea do not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal.

26 Therefore, Apis mellifera bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that A.

 mellifera honeybees are more evolved than Apis florea.

27
Another means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal.

 Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming.

 A worker bee vibrates its body dorsoventrally while holding another bee with its front legs.

 Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager's life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92.

1 percent of observed shaking signals and 64 percent of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source.

 About 71 percent of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes.

 Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels).

 Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones.

 At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism.

 However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees.

 All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.


Pheromonesedit
Main article: Honey bee pheromones
Pheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey-bee survival.

 Honey bees rely on pheromones for nearly all behaviors, including mating, alarm, defense, orientation, kin and colony recognition, food production and integrating colony activities.

Domesticationedit

Further information: Domestication
The honey bee is one of the few invertebrate animals to have been domesticated.

 Humans collected wild honey in the Palaeolithic or Mesolithic periods, with evidence from rock art from France and Spain around 8,000 years old.

 Bees were likely first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where tomb paintings depict bee-keeping.

 Europeans brought bees to North America in 1622.

3031
Beekeepers have selected bees for several desirable features:30
	the ability of a colony to survive periods with little food30
	the ability of a colony to survive cold weather30
	resistance to disease30
	increased honey-production30
	reduced aggressiveness30
	reduced tendency to swarm30
	reduced nest-building30
	easy pacification with smoke30
These modifications, along with artificial change of location, have improved bees from the point of view of the bee-keeper, and simultaneously made them more dependent on bee-keepers for their survival.

 In Europe, cold-weather survival was likely selected for, consciously or not, while in Africa, selection probably favoured the ability to survive heat, drought, and heavy rain.

30
Authors do not agree on whether this degree of artificial selection constitutes genuine domestication.

 In 1603 John Guillim wrote "The Bee I may well reckon a domestik Insect, being so pliable to the Benefit of the Keeper.

"32 More recently, many biologists working on pollination take the domesticated status of honey bees for granted.

3334 For example, Rachael Winfree and colleagues write "We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species.

"35 Similarly, Brian Dennis and William Kemp write: "Although the domestication of the honey bee is closely connected to the evolution of food-based socio-economic systems in many cultures throughout the world, in current economic terms, and in the U.

S.

 alone, the estimated wholesale value of honey, more than $317 million dollars in 2013, pales in comparison to aggregate estimated annual value of pollination services, variously valued at $11¡V15 billion.

"36
On the other hand, P.

 R.

 Oxley and B.

 P.

 Oldroyd (2010) consider the domestication of bees at best partial.

37 Oldroyd observes that the lack of full domestication is somewhat surprising, given that people have kept bees for at least 7000 years.

 Instead, bee-keepers have found ways to manage bees using hives, while the bees remain "largely unchanged from their wild cousins".

38 Leslie Bailey and B.

 V.

 Ball, in their book Honey Bee Pathology, call honey bees "feral insects", in contrast to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) which they call "the only insect that has been domesticated", and refer to the "popular belief among many biologists as well as beekeepers that bees are domesticated".

 They argue that honey bees are able to survive without man's help, and in fact require to "be left at liberty" to survive.

 They argue further that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants.

 Therefore, they argue, bee-keeping is "the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in.

39 Pilar de la Rua and colleagues likewise argue that honey bees are not fully domesticated, since "endemic subspecies-specific genetic footprints can still be identified in Europe and Africa", making conservation of wild-bee diversity important.

 They further argue that the difficulty of controlling drones for mating is a serious handicap and a sign that domestication is not complete, in particular as "extensive gene flow usually occurs between wild/feral and managed honeybee populations".

Queen bee with workers
The honey bee is a colonial insect which is housed, transported by and sometimes fed by beekeepers.

 Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (a superorganism).


Honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to honey, which is stored in the hive.

 The nectar, transported in the bees' stomachs, is converted with the addition of digestive enzymes and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration.

 Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter.

 Honey bees also collect pollen, which supplies protein and fat for the bee brood to grow.

 Centuries of selective breeding by humans have created bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.



Honey bees removed from the hive for inspection by a beekeeper
Beekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey.

 There are seven basic types of beehive: skeps, Langstroth hives, top-bar hives, box hives, log gums, D.

 E.

 hive, and miller hives.

 All U.

S.

 states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease.

 This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.

E.

 hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use.

 Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).


In cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter.

 While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of dysentery and causes an excessive buildup of carbon dioxide from the bees' respiration.

 Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon-dioxide dispersal.

Honey beesedit
A primary product of honey bees is more honey bees.

 Honey bees are bought as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen with 2 to 5 pounds (0.

91 to 2.

27 kg) of bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood) and as full colonies.

 Commerce in bees dates to prehistory, and modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date to the late 1800s.

 Bees are typically produced in temperate to tropical regions and sold to colder areas; packages of bees produced in Florida are sold to beekeepers in Michigan.

Pollinationedit

Honey bee pollinating a flower
Main articles: Pollination management and List of crop plants pollinated by bees
The honey bee's primary commercial value is as a pollinator of crops.

 Although orchards and fields have increased in size, wild pollinators have dwindled.

 In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period.

 Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services.

 At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to winter over sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants.

 Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes.

 In California almond pollination occurs in February, early in the growing season before local hives have built up their populations.


Almond orchards require two hives per acre (2,000 m2 per hive) for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates.

 Almond pollination (in February and March in the United States) is the largest managed pollination event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country.

 Mass movements of bees are also made for apples in New York, Michigan, and Washington.

 Despite honey bees' inefficiency as blueberry pollinators,41 large numbers are moved to Maine because they are the only pollinators who can be easily moved and concentrated for this and other monoculture crops.

 Bees and other insects maintain flower constancy by transferring pollen to other biologically specific plants;42 this prevents flower stigmas from being clogged with pollen from other species.

43
Honeyedit
Main article: Honey
Honey is the complex substance made from nectar and sweet deposits from plants and trees which are gathered, modified and stored in the comb by honey bees.

44 Honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars, primarily glucose and fructose.

 It has antibacterial and antifungal properties.

 Honey from the Western honey bee, along with the bee Tetragonisca angustula, has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus.

45 Honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions, however it will crystallize over time.

 Although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use, bees can only use liquid honey and will remove and discard crystallized honey from the hive.



Honey bee with "tongue" partially extended
Bees produce honey by collecting nectar, a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and complex sugars.

 The collecting bees store the nectar in a second stomach and return to the hive, where worker bees remove the nectar.

 The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes, using enzymes to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones.

 Raw honey is then spread in empty honeycomb cells to dry, reducing its water content to less than 20 percent.

 When nectar is being processed, honey bees create a draft through the hive by fanning with their wings.

 When the honey has dried, the honeycomb cells are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve it.


Beeswaxedit
Main article: Beeswax
Mature worker bees secrete beeswax from glands on their abdomen, using it to form the walls and caps of the comb.

46 When honey is harvested, the wax can be collected for use in products like candles and seals.


Pollenedit
Further information: Pollen
Bees collect pollen in a pollen basket and carry it back to the hive, where it is a protein source for brood-rearing.

47 Excess pollen can be collected from the hive; although it is sometimes consumed as a dietary supplement by humans, bee pollen may cause an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals.


Propolisedit
Main article: Propolis
Propolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from tree buds, sap flows or other botanical sources, which is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive.

48 Although propolis is alleged to have health benefits (tincture of Propolis is marketed as a cold and flu remedy), it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals.

49 Propolis is also used in wood finishes, and gives a Stradivarius violin its unique red color.

Genomeedit
See also: Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium and Subspecies of Apis mellifera
As of October 28, 2006, the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium fully sequenced and analyzed the genome of Apis mellifera.

 Since 2007, attention has been devoted to colony collapse disorder, a decline in European honey bee colonies in a number of regions.


The European honey bee is the third insect, after the fruit fly and the mosquito, to have its genome mapped.

 According to scientists who analyzed its genetic code, the honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Europe in two ancient migrations.

4 Scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste, and the European honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito.

55 The genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes, particularly those related to circadian rhythm, resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects.

 Another significant finding from the honey bee genome study was that honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional DNA methylation system because functional key enzymes (DNA methyl-transferase 1 and 3) were identified in the genome.

 DNA methylation is one of the important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the DNA sequence, but modifications on the DNA.

56 DNA methylation later was identified to play an important role in gene regulation and gene alternative splicing.

57 The genome is unusual in having few transposable elements, although they were present in the evolutionary past (inactive remains have been found) and evolved more slowly than those in fly species.

55
Hazards and survivaledit
European honey-bee populations face threats to their survival, increasing interests in other pollinator species like B.

 impatiens.

58 North American and European populations were severely depleted by varroa-mite infestations during the early 1990s, and US beekeepers were further affected by colony collapse disorder in 2006 and 2007.

59 Improved cultural practices and chemical treatments against varroa mites saved most commercial operations; new bee breeds are beginning to reduce beekeeper dependence on acaricides.

 Feral bee populations were greatly reduced during this period; they are slowly recovering, primarily in mild climates, due to natural selection for varroa resistance and repopulation by resistant breeds.

 Insecticides, particularly when used in excess of label directions, have also depleted bee populationscitation needed as bee pests and diseases (including American foulbrood and tracheal mites) are becoming resistant to medications.


Environmental hazardsedit

An African honey bee in Tanzaniaextracts nectar from a flower, as pollen grains stick to its body
Africanized bees have spread across the southern United States, where they pose a slight danger to humans (making beekeeping¡Xparticularly hobby beekeeping¡Xdifficult).

 As an invasive species, feral honey bees have become a significant environmental problem in non-native areas.

 Imported bees may displace native bees and birds, and may also promote the reproduction of invasive plants ignored by native pollinators.

 Unlike native bees, they do not properly extract or transfer pollen from plants with pore anthers (anthers which only release pollen through tiny apical pores); this requires buzz pollination, a behavior rarely exhibited by honey bees.

 Honey bees reduce fruiting in Melastoma affine, a plant with pore anthers, by robbing its stigmas of previously deposited pollen.

60
Predatorsedit
Insect predators of honeybees include the Asian giant hornet and other wasps, robber flies, dragonflies such as the green darner, the European beewolf, some Praying mantises, and the water strider.


Arachnid predators of honeybees include fishing spiders, lynx spiders, goldenrod spiders61 and the St Andrew's Cross spider.


Reptile and amphibian predators of honeybees include the American toad, Anole lizards, the American bullfrog and the wood Frog.


Specialist bird predators include the bee-eaters; other birds that may take bees include grackles, hummingbirds, Summer tanager, and tyrant flycatchers.

 Most birds that eat bees do so opportunistically, however, summer tanagers will sit on a limb and catch dozens of bees from the hive entrance.

62
Mammals that sometimes take bees include bears, least shrews, opossums, raccoons, honey badgers and skunks.


Close Relativesedit
Apart from Apis mellifera, there are 6 other species in the genus Apis.

 These are Apis andreniformis, Apis florea, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana, Apis koschevnikovi, and Apis nigrocincta.

63 These other species all originated in South and Southeast Asia.

 Only Apis mellifera is thought to have originated in Europe, Asia, and Africa.


The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) or domestic Asian water buffalo is a large bovid originating in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China.

 Today, it is also found in Europe, Australia, South America and some African countries.

1 The wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) native to Southeast Asia is considered a different species, but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.

2
Two extant types of domestic water buffalo are recognized based on morphological and behavioural criteria ¡V the river buffaloof South Asia and further west to the Balkans, Egypt, and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east.

13 The origins of the domestic water buffalo types are debated, although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago, while the river type may have originated from India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago.

4Water buffalo were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia, in modern Iraq, 2500 BC by the Meluhhas.

5 The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffalo.

6
At least 130 million domestic water buffalo exist, and more people depend on them than on any other domestic animal.

7 They are especially suitable for tilling rice fields, and their milk is richer in fat and protein than that of dairy cattle.

 The large feralpopulation of northern Australia became established in the late 19th century, and smaller feral herds are in New Guinea, Tunisia, and northeastern Argentina.

1 Feral herds are also present in New Britain, New Ireland, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, and Uruguay.

A water buffalo in Thailand

An albino swamp buffalo in Chiang Mai province, Thailand
The skin of river buffalo is black, but some specimens may have dark, slate-coloured skin.

 Swamp buffalo have a grey skin at birth, but become slate blue later.

 Albinoids are present in some populations.

 River buffalo have comparatively longer faces, smaller girths, and bigger limbs than swamp buffalo.

 Their dorsal ridges extend further back and taper off more gradually.

 Their horns grow downward and backward, then curve upward in a spiral.

 Swamp buffalo are heavy-bodied and stockily built; the body is short and the belly large.

 The forehead is flat, the eyes prominent, the face short, and the muzzlewide.

 The neck is comparatively long, and the withers and croup are prominent.

 A dorsal ridge extends backward and ends abruptly just before the end of the chest.

 Their horns grow outward, and curve in a semicircle, but always remain more or less on the plane of the forehead.

 The tail is short, reaching only to the hocks.

 Height at withers is 129¡V133 cm (51¡V52 in) for males, and 120¡V127 cm (47¡V50 in) for females.

 They range in weight from 300¡V550 kg (660¡V1,210 lb), but weights of over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) have also been observed.

The swamp buffalo has 48 chromosomes; the river buffalo has 50 chromosomes.

 The two types do not readily interbreed, but fertile offspring can occur.

 Buffalo-cattle hybrids have not been observed to occur, but the embryos of such hybrids reach maturity in laboratory experiments, albeit at lower rates than non-hybrids.

10
The rumen of the water buffalo has important differences from that of other ruminants.

11 It contains a larger population of bacteria, particularly the cellulolytic bacteria, lower protozoa, and higher fungi zoospores.

 In addition, higher rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and higher pH have been found as compared to those in cattle.

Ecology and behavioredit

Water buffalo enjoy being in water.



Water buffalo wallowing in mud
River buffalo prefer deep water.

 Swamp buffalo prefer to wallow in mudholes which they make with their horns.

 During wallowing, they acquire a thick coating of mud.

1 Both are well adapted to a hot and humid climate with temperatures ranging from 0 ¢XC (32 ¢XF) in the winter to 30 ¢XC (86 ¢XF) and greater in the summer.

 Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in thermoregulation.

 Some breeds are adapted to saline seaside shores and saline sandy terrain.

13
Dietedit
Water buffalo thrive on many aquatic plants and during floods, will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants.

 They eat reeds, Arundo donax, a kind of Cyperaceae, Eichhornia crassipes, and Juncaceae.

 Some of these plants are of great value to local peoples.

 Others, such as E.

 crassipes, are a major problem in some tropical valleys and water buffalo may help to keep waterways clear.


Green fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening.

 Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped.

 Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips.

 Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo.

 In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% of the standard feed mixture.

Reproductionedit

A water buffalo calf in India
Swamp buffalo generally become reproductive at an older age than river breeds.

 Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.

0¡V3.

5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age.

 Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older.

 A good river male can impregnate 100 females in a year.

 A strong seasonal influence on mating occurs.

 Heat stress reduces libido.

1
Although buffalo are polyoestrous, their reproductive efficiency shows wide variation throughout the year.

 Buffalo cows exhibit a distinct seasonal change in displaying oestrus, conception rate, and calving rate.

14 The age at first oestrus of heifers varies between breeds from 13¡V33 months, but mating at the first oestrus is often infertile and usually deferred until they are 3 years old.

 Gestation lasts from 281¡V334 days, but most reports give a range between 300 and 320 days.

 Swamp buffalo carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffalo.

 It is not rare to find buffalo that continue to work well at the age of 30, and instances of a working life of 40 years are recorded.

Taxonomic historyedit

Water buffalo
Carl Linnaeus first described the genus Bos and the water buffalo under the binomial Bos bubalis in 1758; the species was known to occur in Asia and was held as a domestic form in Italy.

15 Ellerman and Morrison-Scott treated the wild and domestic forms of the water buffalo as conspecifics,16 whereas others treated them as different species.

17 The nomenclatorialtreatment of wild and domestic forms has been inconsistent and varies between authors and even within the works of single authors.

18
In March 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature achieved consistency in the naming of wild and domestic water buffalo by ruling that the scientific name Bubalus arnee is valid for the wild form.

19 B.

 bubalis continues to be valid for the domestic form and applies also to feral populations.

Domestication and breedingedit

Murrah buffalo at the Philippine Carabao Center
Water buffalo were domesticated in Indian subcontinent about 5000 years ago, and in China about 4000 years ago.

 Two types are recognized, based on morphological and behavioural criteria ¡V the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east.

3 The present-day river buffalo is the result of complex domestication processes involving more than one maternal lineage and a significant maternal gene flow from wild populations after the initial domestication events.

21 Twenty-two breeds of the river type water buffalo are known, including Murrah, NiliRavi, Surti, Jafarabadi, Anatolian, Mediterranean, and Egyptian buffalo.

22 China has a huge variety of buffalo genetic resources, comprising 16 local swamp buffalo breeds in various regions.

13
Results of mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate that the two types were domesticated independently.

23 Sequencing of cytochrome b genes of Bubalus species implies that the domestic buffalo originated from at least two populations, and that the river and the swamp types have differentiated at the full species level.

 The genetic distance between the two types is so large that a divergence time of about 1.

7 million years has been suggested.

 The swamp type was noticed to have the closest relationship with the tamaraw.

Distribution of populationsedit

Carabao buffalo in the Philippines
The water buffalo population in the world is about 172 million.

More than 95.

8% of the world population of water buffalo are found in Asia, including both river and swamp types.

13 The water buffalo population in India numbered over 97.

9 million head in 2003, representing 56.

5% of the world population.

 They are primarily of the river type, with 10 well-defined breeds comprising Badhawari, Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Jafarabadi, Marathwada, Mehsana, Nagpuri, Pandharpuri, Toda, and Surti.

 Swamp buffalo occur only in small areas in the north-eastern part of the country and are not distinguished into breeds.

26
In 2003, the second-largest population lived in China, with 22.

76 million head, all of the swamp type with breeds kept only in the lowlands, and other breeds kept only in the mountains; as of 2003, 3.

2 million swamp-type carabao buffalo were in the Philippines, nearly three million swamp buffalo were in Vietnam, and 772,764 buffalo were in Bangladesh.

 About 750,000 head were estimated in Sri Lanka in 1997.

13 In Japan, water buffalo is domestic animal throughout the Ryukyuan islands or Okinawa prefecture.

 It was also recorded that 889,246 buffalo were in Nepal.


The water buffalo is the main dairy animal in Pakistan, with 23.

47 million head in 2010.

27 Of these, 76% are kept in the Punjab.

 The rest of them are mostly in the province of Sindh.

 Breeds used are NiliRavi, Kundi, and Azi Kheli.

28 Karachi has the largest population of water buffalos for an area where fodder is not grown, consisting of 350,000 head kept mainly for milking.

In Thailand, the number of water buffalo dropped from more than 3 million head in 1996 to less than 1.

24 million head in 2011.

29 Slightly over 75% of them are kept in the country's northeastern region.

 The statistics also indicate that by the beginning of 2012, less than one million were in the country, partly as a result of illegal shipments to neighboring countries where sales prices are higher than in Thailand.

Water buffalo are also present in the southern region of Iraq in the Mesopotamian Marshes.

 The draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes by Saddam Hussein was an attempt to punish the south for the 1991 uprisings in Iraq.

 After 2003 and the Firdos Square statue destruction, these lands were reflooded and a 2007 report on Maysan and Dhi Qar shows a steady increase in the number of water buffalo.

 The report puts the number at 40,008 head in those two provinces.

In Europe and the Mediterraneanedit
Water buffalo were probably introduced to Europe from India or other Oriental countries.

 In Italy, the Longobard King Agilulf is said to have received water buffalo in about the year 600.

 These were probably a present from the Khan of the Avars, a Turkic nomadic tribe that dwelt near the Danube River at the time.

 Sir H.

 Johnstonknew of a herd of water buffalo presented by a King of Naples to the Bey of Tunis in the mid-19th century that had resumed the feral state in northern Tunis.

31
European buffalo are all of the river type and considered to be of the same breed named Mediterranean buffalo.

 In Italy, the Mediterranean type was particularly selected and is called Mediterranean Italian breed to distinguish it from other European breeds, which differ genetically.

 Mediterranean buffalo are also found in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Kosovo, and the Republic of Macedonia, with a few hundred in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hungary.

 Little exchange of breeding buffalo has occurred among countries, so each population has its own phenotypic features and performances.

 In Bulgaria, they were crossbred with the Indian Murrah breed, and in Romania, some were crossbred with Bulgarian Murrah.

13 Populations in Turkey are of the Anatolian buffalo breed.

In Australiaedit

A feral water buffalo in Australia
Between 1824 and 1849, water buffalo were introduced into the Northern Territory from Timor, Kisar, and probably other islands in the Indonesian archipelago.

 In 1886, a few milking types were brought from India to Darwin.

 They have been the main grazing animals on the subcoastal plains and river basins between Darwin and Arnhem Land since the 1880s.

 In the early 1960s, an estimated population of 150,000 to 200,000 buffalo were living in the plains and nearby areas.

32
They became feral and are causing significant environmental damage.

 Buffalo are also found in the Top End.

 As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980.

 The commencement of the brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s.

 The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997.

 Numbers dropped dramatically as a result of the campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.

33
During the 1950s, buffalo were hunted for their skins and meat, which was exported and used in the local trade.

 In the late 1970s, live exports were made to Cuba and continued later into other countries.

 Buffalo are now crossed with riverine buffalo in artificial insemination programs, and may be found in many areas of Australia.

 Some of these crossbreds are used for milk production.

 Melville Island is a popular hunting location, where a steady population up to 4,000 individuals exists.

 Safari outfits are run from Darwin to Melville Island and other locations in the Top End, often with the use of bush pilots.

 The horns, which can measure up to a record of 3.

1 m (10 ft) tip-to-tip, are prized hunting trophies.

34
The buffalo have developed a different appearance from the Indonesian buffalo from which they descend.

citation needed They live mainly in freshwater marshes and billabongs, and their territory range can be quite expansive during the wet season.

 Their only natural predators in Australia are adult saltwater crocodiles, with whom they share the billabongs, and dingoes, which have been known to prey on buffalo calves and occasionally adult buffalo when the dingoes are in large packs.

Buffalo were exported live to Indonesia until 2011, at a rate of about 3000 per year.

 After the live export ban that year, the exports dropped to zero, and had not resumed as of June 2013.

In South Americaedit

Murrah buffalo in a Brazilian Farm
Water buffalo were introduced into the Amazon River basin in 1895.

 They are now extensively used there for meat and dairy production.

 In 2005, the buffalo herd in the Brazilian Amazon stood at roughly 1.

6 million head, of which 460,000 were located in the lower Amazon floodplain.

36 Breeds used include Mediterranean from Italy, Murrah and Jafarabadi from India, and Carabao from the Philippines.


During the 1970s, small herds were imported to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Cayenne, Panama, Surinam, Guyana, and Venezuela.

37
In Argentina, many game ranches raise water buffalo for commercial hunting.

In North Americaedit
In 1974, four water buffalo were imported to the United States from Guam to be studied at the University of Florida.

 In February 1978, the first herd arrived for commercial farming.

 Until 2002, only one commercial breeder was in the United States.

 Water buffalo meat is imported from Australia.

37 Until 2011, water buffalo were raised in Gainesville, Florida, from young obtained from zoo overflow.

 They were used primarily for meat production, frequently sold as hamburger.

38 Other US ranchers use them for production of high-quality mozzarella cheese.

The husbandry system of water buffalo depends on the purpose for which they are bred and maintained.

 Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units.

 Their buffalo live in very close association with them, and are often their greatest capital asset.

 The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals.

 Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places.

 Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints.

 They are often referred to as "the living tractor of the East".

 It probably is possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses.

 They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields.

 In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest.

 They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water.

 They are widely used as pack animals, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage.

 In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams.

 Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.

1
Buffalo contribute 72 million tones of milk and three million tones of meat annually to world food, much of it in areas that are prone to nutritional imbalances.

 In India, river-type buffalo are kept mainly for milk production and for transport, whereas swamp-type buffalo are kept mainly for work and a small amount of milk.

Dairy products of water buffalo milk
Water buffalo milk presents physicochemical features different from that of other ruminant species, such as a higher content of fatty acids and proteins.

43 The physical and chemical parameters of swamp and river type water buffalo milk differ.

44 Water buffalo milk contains higher levels of total solids, crude protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus, and slightly higher content of lactose compared with those of cow milk.

 The high level of total solids makes water buffalo milk ideal for processing into value-added dairy products such as cheese.

 The conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in milk ranged from 4.

4 mg/g fat in September to 7.

6 mg/g fat in June.

 Seasons and genetics may play a role in variation of CLA level and changes in gross composition of the water buffalo milk.

45
Water buffalo milk is processed into a large variety of dairy products:46
	Cream churns much faster at higher fat levels and gives higher overrun than cow cream.

	
	Butter from water buffalo cream displays more stability than that from cow cream.

	
	Ghee from water buffalo milk has a different texture with a bigger grain size than ghee from cow milk.

	
	Heat-concentrated milk products in the Indian subcontinent include paneer, khoa, rabri, kheer and basundi.

	
	Fermented milk products include dahi, yogurt, and chakka.

	
	Whey is used for making ricotta and mascarpone in Italy, and alkarish in Syria and Egypt.

	
	Soft cheeses made include mozzarella in Italy, karish, mish, and domiati in Egypt, madhfor in Iraq, alghab in Syria, kesong puti in the Philippines, and vladeasa in Romania.

	
	The semihard cheese beyaz peynir is made in Turkey.

	
	Hard cheeses include braila in Romania, rahss in Egypt,47 white brine in Bulgaria, and akkawi in Syria.

	
	Watered-down buffalo milk is used as a cheaper alternative to regular milk.

Main article: Buffalo meat
Water buffalo meat, sometimes called "carabeef", is often passed off as beef in certain regions, and is also a major source of export revenue for India.

 In many Asian regions, buffalo meat is less preferred due to its toughness; however, recipes have evolved (rendang, for example) where the slow cooking process and spices not only make the meat palatable, but also preserve it, an important factor in hot climates where refrigeration is not always available.

Environmental effectsedit
Wildlife conservation scientists have started to recommend and use introduced populations of feral domestic water buffalo in far-away lands to manage uncontrolled vegetation growth in and around natural wetlands.

 Introduced water buffalo at home in such environs provide cheap service by regularly grazing the uncontrolled vegetation and opening up clogged water bodies for waterfowl, wetland birds, and other wildlife.

5152 Grazing water buffalo are sometimes used in Great Britain for conservation grazing, such as in Chippenham Fen National Nature Reserve.

 The buffalo can better adapt to wet conditions and poor-quality vegetation than cattle.

53
Currently, research is being conducted at the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies to determine the levels of nutrients removed and returned to wetlands when water buffalo are used for wetland vegetation management.

In 2007, the development of Southeast Asia's first cloned buffalo was announced in the Philippines.

 The Department of Agriculture's Philippine Carabao Center implemented cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer as a tool for genetic improvement in water buffalo to produce "super buffalo calves" by multiplying existing germplasms but without modifying or altering genetic material.

55
In January 2008, the Philippine Carabao Center in Nueva Ecija, per Filipino scientists, initiated a study to breed a super water buffalo that could produce 4 to 18 litres of milk per day using gene-based technology.

 Also, the first in vitro river buffalo was born there in 2004 from an in vitro-produced, vitrified embryo, named "Glory" after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

 Joseph Estrada's most successful project as an opposition senator, the PCC was created through Republic Act 3707, the Carabao Act of 1992.

Indian scientists from the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal developed a cloned buffalo in 2010.

 The buffalo calf was named Samrupa.

 The calf did not survive more than a week, due to genetic defects.

 A few months later, a second cloned calf was successfully born, named Garima.

57 The Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes, India's premier research institute on buffalo, also became the second institute in the world to successfully clone the buffalo in 2016.

Domestic duck refers to any species of duck that has been domesticated.

 They may be reared for meat, eggs, or down.

 Domestic ducks are also kept for show, as pets, or for their ornamental value.

 Almost all varieties of domestic duck apart from the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) are descended from the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).

Domesticationedit
Further information: Domestication and List of duck breeds

Ducks were common in Ancient Egypt, as depicted in this 3rd century BC faience vase.


Mallard ducks were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia.

34 In ancient Egypt, ducks were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.

5 During the Ming Dynasty, the Peking duck¡Xmallards force-fed on grains, making them larger¡X was known to have good genetic characteristics.

6
Almost all varieties of domestic duck except the muscovy have been derived from the mallard.

7 Domestication has greatly altered their characteristics.

 Domestic ducks are mostly polygamous, where wild mallards are monogamous.

 Domestic ducks have lost the mallard's territorial behaviour, and are less aggressive than mallards.

89 Despite these differences, domestic ducks frequently mate with wild mallard, producing fully fertile hybrid offspring.

Farmingedit

A duck farm in Taiwan
Ducks have been farmed for thousands of years.

11 In the Western world, they are not as popular as the chicken, because chickens have much more white lean meat and are easier to keep confined, making the total price much lower for chicken meat, whereas duck is comparatively expensive.

 While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry and restaurants in the lower price range.

 However, ducks are more popular in China and there they are raised extensively.

Ducks are farmed for their meat, eggs, and down.

 A minority of ducks are also kept for foie gras production.

 The blood of ducks slaughtered for meat is also collected in some regions and is used as an ingredient in many cultures' dishes.

 Their eggs are blue-green to white, depending on the breed.

citation needed
Ducks can be kept free range, in cages, in barns, or in batteries.

 Ducks enjoy access to swimming water, but do not require it to survive.

 They should be fed a grain and insect diet.

 It is a popular misconception that ducks should be fed bread; bread has limited nutritional value and can be deadly when fed to developing ducklings.

 Ducks should be monitored for avian influenza, as they are especially prone to infection with the dangerous H5N1strain.

citation needed
The females of many breeds of domestic ducks are unreliable at sitting their eggs and raising their young.

 Exceptions include the Rouen duck and especially the Muscovy duck.

 It has been a custom on farms for centuries to put duck eggs under broody hens for hatching; nowadays this role is often played by an incubator.

 However, young ducklings rely on their mothers for a supply of preen oil to make them waterproof; a chicken hen does not make as much preen oil as a female duck, and an incubator makes none.

 Once the duckling grows its own feathers, it produces preen oil from the sebaceous gland near the base of its tail.

Domestic duckling

The Muscovy duck (drake shown) is the only domestic breed not derived from the mallard.


Domestic ducks can be kept as pets, in a garden or backyard, generally with a pond or deep water dish.

 If they are given access to a pond, they dabble in the mud, dredging out and eating wildlife and frog spawn, and swallow adult frogs and toads up to the size of the common frogRana temporaria, as they have been bred to be much bigger than wild ducks, with a waterline length (base of neck to base of tail) of up to 1 foot (30 cm); the wild mallard's waterline length is about 6 inches (15 cm).

 Protection from predators such as foxes and hawks is required.

Ducks are also kept for their ornamental value.

 Breeds have been developed with crests and tufts or striking plumage, for exhibition in competitions.

Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck
The domestic duck has appeared numerous times in children's stories.

 Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck was published by Frederick Warne & Co in 1908.

 One of Potter's best-known books, the tale was included in the Royal Ballet's The Tales of Beatrix Potter.

13 It is the story of how Jemima, a domestic duck, is saved from a cunning fox who plans to kill her, when she tries to find a safe place for her eggs to hatch.

In musicedit
The domestic duck features in the musical composition Peter and the Wolf, written by Sergei Prokofiev in 1936.

 The orchestra illustrates the children's story while the narrator tells it.

15 In this, a domestic duck and a little bird argue on each other's flight capabilities.

 The duck is represented by the oboe.

 The story ends with the wolf eating the duck alive, its quack heard from inside the wolf's belly.

Since ancient times, the duck has been eaten as food.

19 Usually only the breast and thigh meat is eaten.

20 It does not need to be hung before preparation, and is often braised or roasted, sometimes flavoured with bitter orange or with port.

21 Peking duck is a dish of roast duck from Beijing, China that has been prepared since medieval times.

 It is today traditionally served with spring pancakes, spring onions and sweet bean sauce.


The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus)12 is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae.

 The wild ancestor of the donkey is the African wild ass, E.

 africanus.

 The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years.

 There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals.

 Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels.

 Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.


A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;345 a young donkey is a foal.

5 Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules; the biological "reciprocal" of a mule, from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead, is called a hinny.


Asses were first domesticated around 3000 BC, probably in Egypt or Mesopotamia,67 and have spread around the world.

 They continue to fill important roles in many places today.

 While domesticated species are increasing in numbers, the African wild ass is an endangered species.

 As beasts of burden and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.

Scientific and common names
Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is Equus asinus asinus based on the principle of priority used for scientific names of animals.

 However, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled in 2003 that if the domestic species and the wild species are considered subspecies of one another, the scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies.

2 This means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is Equus africanus asinus when it is considered a subspecies, and Equus asinus when it is considered a species.


At one time, the synonym ass was the more common term for the donkey.

 The first recorded use of donkey was in either 17848 or 1785.

91011 While the word asshas cognates in most other Indo-European languages, donkey is an etymologically obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified.

 Hypotheses on its derivation include the following:
	Perhaps from Spanish, for its don-like gravity; the donkey was also known as "the King of Spain's trumpeter"10
	Perhaps a diminutive of dun (dull grayish-brown), a typical donkey colour.

	912
	Perhaps from the name Duncan.

	913
	Perhaps of imitative origin.

	13
From the 18th century, donkey gradually replaced ass, and jenny replaced she-ass, which is now considered archaic.

14 The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of rooster for cock, or that of rabbit for coney, which was formerly homophonic with cunny.

 By the end of the 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ass and arse had caused them to become homophones.

 Other words used for the ass in English from this time include cuddy in Scotland, neddy in southwest England and dicky in the southeast;11 moke is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.


Characteristics
See also: List of donkey breeds

Classic British seaside donkeys in Skegness
Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management.

 The height at the withers ranges from 7.

3 to 15.

3 hands (31 to 63 inches, 79 to 160 cm), and the weight from 80 to 480 kg (180 to 1,060 lb).

 Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years;15 in more prosperous countries, they may have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.

5
Donkeys are adapted to marginal desert lands.

 Unlike wild and feral horses, wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form harems.

 Each adult donkey establishes a home range; breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack.

16 The loud call or bray of the donkey, which typically lasts for twenty seconds1718 and can be heard for over three kilometres, may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert.

19 Donkeys have large ears, which may pick up more distant sounds, and may help cool the donkey's blood.

20 Donkeys can defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs.


Breeding

A 3-week-old donkey
A jenny is normally pregnant for about 12 months, though the gestation period varies from 11 to 14 months,521 and usually gives birth to a single foal.

 Births of twins are rare, though less so than in horses.

5 About 1.

7 percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins; both foals survive in about 14 percent of those.

22 In general jennies have a conception rate that is lower than that of horses (i.

e.

 less than the 60¡V65% rate for mares).

5
Although jennies come into heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their fertility remains low, and it is likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal.

5 Thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares.

 Jennies are usually very protective of their foals, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side.

23 The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year.

 Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.

5
Donkeys can interbreed with other members of the family Equidae, and are commonly interbred with horses.

 The hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule, valued as a working and riding animal in many countries.

 Some large donkey breeds such as the Asino di Martina Franca, the Baudet de Poitou and the Mammoth Jack are raised only for mule production.

 The hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny, and is less common.

 Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile.

5 Donkeys can also breed with zebras in which the offspring is called a zonkey (among other names).


Behaviour
Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of self-preservation than exhibited by horses.

24 Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason.

 Once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.

25
Although formal studies of their behaviour and cognition are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.

History

 Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson using a donkey to carry a wounded soldier at the Battle of Gallipoli.


The ancestors of the modern donkey are the Nubian and Somalian subspecies of African wild ass.

2728 Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in Ma'adi in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC.

 Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in Nubia, and they supplanted the ox as the chief pack animal of that culture.

 The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to chew their cud, and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt.

 In the Dynasty IV era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals.

29 In 2003, the tomb of either King Narmer or King Hor-Aha (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans.

 These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.

30

Feral burros in Red Rock Canyon
By the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding center had shifted to Mesopotamia by 1800 BC.

 The breeding of large, white riding asses made Damascus famouscitation needed, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy gait.

 The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in Arabia.

 By the second millennium BC, the donkey was brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as viticulture was introduced, as the donkey is associated with the Syrian god of wine, Dionysus.

 Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.

29
The first donkeys came to the Americas on ships of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus, and were landed at Hispaniola in 1495.

31 The first to reach North America may have been two animals taken to Mexico by Juan de Zumarraga, the first bishop of Mexico, who arrived there on 6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach what is now the United States may have crossed the Rio Grande with Juan de Onate in April 1598.

32 From that time on they spread northward, finding use in missions and mines.

 Donkeys were documented as present in what today is Arizona in 1679.

 By the Gold Rush years of the 19th century, the burro was the beast of burden of choice of early prospectors in the western United States.

 With the end of the placer mining boom, many of them escaped or were abandoned, and a feral population established itself.


Present status
About 41 million donkeys were reported worldwide in 2006.

33 China had the most with 11 million, followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia and Mexico.

 As of 2017, however, the Chinese population was reported to have dropped to 3 million, with African populations under pressure as well, due to increasing trade and demand for donkey products in China34.

 Some researchers believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted.

In 1997 the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations, conversion of forests to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.

3536 Since then, the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking, falling from 43.

7 million to 43.

5 million between 1995 and 2000, and to only 41 million in 2006.

33 The fall in population is pronounced in developed countries; in Europe, the total number of donkeys fell from 3 million in 1944 to just over 1 million in 1994.

37
The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) of the FAO listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011.

38 In 2000 the number of breeds of donkey recorded worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77.

 The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal Genetic Resources project.

33 The rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries.

 In France, for example, only one breed, the Baudet de Poitou, was recognised prior to the early 1990s; by 2005, a further six donkey breeds had official recognition.

39
In prosperous countries, the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has become a concern, and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up.

 The largest is the Donkey Sanctuary of England, which also supports donkey welfare projects in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Mexico.

Uses
Economic use

The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years.

 Of the more than 40 million donkeys in the world, about 96% are in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture.

 After human labour, the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power.

41 They may also be ridden, or used for threshing, raising water, milling and other work.

 Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels.

42 Some cultures that prohibit women from working with oxen in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys, allowing them to be used by both sexes.

43
In developed countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared, donkeys are used to sire mules, to guard sheep,2944 for donkey rides for children or tourists, and as pets.

 Donkeys may be pastured or stabled with horses and ponies, and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses.

 If a donkey is introduced to a mare and foal, the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mother.

45
A few donkeys are milked or raised for meat;35 in Italy, which has the highest consumption of equine meat in Europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, about 1000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately 100 tonnes of meat.

46 Asses' milk may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was £á15 per litre,47 and a price of £á6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes.

 The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding.

33 In the past, donkey skin was used in the production of parchment.

33 In 2017, the UK based charity The Donkey Sanctuary estimates that 1.

8 million skins were traded every year, but the demand could be as high as 10 million.

48
In China, donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes, and Guo Li Zhuangrestaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes.

 Donkey-hide gelatin is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product.

 Ejiao, the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 per kilo, at October 2017 prices.


In 2017, a drop in the number of Chinese donkeys, combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa.

 As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, Kenya opened three donkey abattoirs.

 Concerns for donkey's wellbeing, however, have resulted in a number of African countries (including Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal) banning China from buying their donkey products.

48
In warfare
During World War I John Simpson Kirkpatrick, a British stretcher bearer serving with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson of the New Zealand Medical Corps used donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at Gallipoli.

4950
According to British food writer Matthew Fort, donkeys were used in the Italian Army.

 The Mountain Fusiliers each had a donkey to carry their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be eaten.

51
Donkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the war in Afghanistan and others.

Care
Shoeing
Donkey hooves are more elastic than those of horses, and do not naturally wear down as fast.

 Regular clipping may be required; neglect can lead to permanent damage.

5 Working donkeys may need to be shod.

 Donkey shoes are similar to horseshoes, but usually smaller and without toe-clips.

Nutrition
In their native arid and semi-arid climates, donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub.

54 The donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine.

54 While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient.

 It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight,55 approximately 1.

5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter,56 compared to the 2¡V2.

5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse.

57 Donkeys are also less prone to colic.

58 The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.

59

Poitou donkeys.


Donkeys obtain most of their energy from structural carbohydrates.

 Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only straw(preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or hay in the winter,60 to get all the energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals,5 and others advise against feeding straw.

61 They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods.

 They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought.

 If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.

 They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.

62 In a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis.

63
Throughout the world, working donkeys are associated with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level.

42Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the Third World are under-nourished and over-worked.

64 In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder (laminitis) and hyperlipaemia,60 or to gastric ulcers.

65
Burro

A burro pulling a cart during the Carnival of Huejotzingo
In the Iberian Peninsula and the Americas, a burro is a small donkey.

 The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) of the FAO lists the burro as a specific breed of ass.

66 In Mexico, the donkey population is estimated at three million.

67 There are also substantial burro populations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.


Burro is the Spanish and Portuguese word for donkey.

 In Spanish, burros may also be called burro mexicano ('Mexican donkey'), burro criollo ('Criollo donkey'), or burro criollo mexicano.

 In the United States, "burro" is used as a loan word by English speakers to describe any small donkey used primarily as a pack animal, as well as to describe the feral donkeys that live in Arizona, California, Oregon, Utah, Texas and Nevada.

61
Among donkeys, burros tend to be on the small side.

 A study of working burros in central Mexico found a weight range of 50¡V186 kilograms (110¡V410 lb), with an average weight of 122 kg (269 lb) for males and 112 kg (247 lb) for females.

 Height at the withers varied from 87¡V120 cm (34¡V47 in), with an average of approximately 108 cm (43 in), and girth measurements ranged from 88¡V152 cm (35¡V60 in), with an average of about 120 cm (47 in).

 The average age of the burros in the study was 6.

4 years; evaluated by their teeth, they ranged from 1 to 17 years old.

42 They are gray in color.

 Mexican burros tend to be smaller than their counterparts in the USA, which are both larger and more robust.

 To strengthen their bloodstock, in May 2005, the state of Jalisco imported 11 male and female donkeys from Kentucky.

67
Feral donkeys and wild asses
In some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established feral populations such as those of the Burro of North America and the Asinara donkey of Sardinia, Italy, both of which have protected status.

 Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of equid, such as Hawaii.

68 In Australia, where there may be 5 million feral donkeys,31 they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment.

 They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.

69
Wild asses, onagers, and kiangs
Few species of ass exist in the wild.

 The African wild ass, Equus africanus, has two subspecies, the Somali wild ass, Equus africanus somaliensis, and the Nubian wild ass, Equus africanus africanus,70 the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey.

33 Both are critically endangered.

71 Extinct species include the European ass, Equus hydruntinus, which became extinct during the Neolithic, and the North African wild ass, Equus africanus atlanticus, which became extinct in Roman times.

33
There are five subspecies of Asiatic wild ass or onager, Equus hemionus, and three subspecies of the kiang, Equus kiang, of the Himalayan upland.


Donkey hybrids
A male donkey (jack) can be crossed with a female horse to produce a mule.

 A male horse can be crossed with a female donkey to produce a hinny.


Horse-donkey hybrids are almost always sterile because horses have 64 chromosomes whereas donkeys have 62, producing offspring with 63 chromosomes.

 Mules are much more common than hinnies.

 This is believed to be caused by two factors, the first being proven in cat hybrids, that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher, fertility rates drop (as in the case of stallion x jenney).

citation needed The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss.

 In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology.

 Due to different mating behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennys.

 Further, mares are usually larger than jennys and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth.

 It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce, and it is unquestioned that mules are more common in total number.

citation needed
The offspring of a zebra-donkey cross is called a zonkey, zebroid, zebrass, or zedonk;72 zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today.

 The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey.

 Zebra hinny, zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey.

 Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras.

73There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; there is no such limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.


Cultural references
The long history of human donkey use has created a rich store of cultural references:
Religion, myth and folklore
Jesus rode on a donkey in his triumphal entry into Jerusalem
Due to its widespread domestication and use, the donkey is referred to in myth and folklore around the world.

 In classical and ancient cultures, donkeys had a part.

 The donkey was the symbol of the Egyptian sun god Ra .

74 In Greek myth, Silenus is pictured in Classical Antiquity and during the Renaissance (illustration, left) drunken and riding a donkey, and Midas was given the ears of an ass after misjudging a musical competition.

75
Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the Bible, beginning in the first book and continuing through both Old and New Testaments, so they became part of Judeo-Christian tradition.

 They are portrayed as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender.

 In contrast, horses were represented only in the context of war, ridden by cavalry or pulling chariots.

 Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period.

 Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys ¡X for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made.

76 They are used as a measure of wealth in Genesis 30:43,77 and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of Shechem(the modern Nablus) is named Hamor ("donkey" in Hebrew).

78

Silenus on a donkey, detail from The Discovery of Honey(c.

 1500) by Piero di Cosimo
According to Old Testament prophecy, the Messiah is said to arrive on a donkey: "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey!" (Zechariah 9:9).

 According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus entered Jerusalem riding on the animal (Matthew 21:4-7, John 12:14-15).

 Jesus appeared to be aware of this connection (Matthew 21:1-3, John 12:16).


In the Jewish religion, the donkey is not a kosher animal.

 In the Zohar, it is considered avi avot hatuma or the ultimate impure animal, and doubly "impure", as it is both non-ruminant and non-cloven hoofed.

 However, it is the only impure animal that falls under the mitzvah (commandment) of firstborn ("bechor") consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals (See Petter Chamor).

 In Jewish Oral Tradition (Talmud Bavli), the son of David was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the tribes of Israel are undeserving of redemption.

79
In contemporary Israel, the term "Messiah's Donkey" (Chamoro Shel Mashiach   .
) stands at the center of a controversial religious-political doctrine, under which it was the Heavenly-imposed "task" of secular Zionists to build up a Jewish State, but once the state is established they are fated to give place to the Religious who are ordained to lead the state.

 The secularists in this analogy are "The Donkey" while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective "Messiach".

 A book on the subject, published in 1998 by the militant secularist Sefi Rechlevsky, aroused a major controversy in the Israeli public opinion.

80
With the rise of Christianity, some believers came to see the cross-shaped marking present on donkeys' backs and shoulders as a symbol of the animal's bearing Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday.

 During the Middle Ages, Europeans used hairs from this cross (or contact with a donkey) as folk remedies to treat illness, including measles and whooping cough.

81 Around 1400 AD, one physician listed riding backwards on a donkey as a cure for scorpion stings.

Goddess Kalaratri rides a donkey.


Donkeys are also referred to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the Hinduism, where the goddess Kalaratri's vahana (vehicle) is a donkey.

83 Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the Hitopadesha84 and the Panchatantra.

In Islam, eating the meat of a domestic donkey is not allowed.

Literature and film
Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures.

 The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the Bible and Ancient Greece.

 Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity.

 Donkeys were found in the works of Homer, Aesop and Apuleius, where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the lower class.

 They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful.

 Aesop's The Ass in the Lion's Skin, representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool.

 Apuleius's The Golden Ass (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly.

 This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe.

 During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow.

 Shakespeare popularized the use of the word "ass" as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1600).

 In contrast, a few years later, Cervantes' Don Quixote shows a more positive slant on the donkey, primarily as Sancho Panza's mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions.

 This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.

87
In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the New Testament Nativity narrative.

 Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey.

 By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors.

 William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem Peter Bell:A Tale, using the donkey as a Christian symbol.

 Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden.

 Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I.

 The melancholy Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.

87
Donkeys were featured in literature during the 20th century, including in George Orwell's 1951 Animal Farm, where Benjamin the donkey is portrayed as resilient and loyal.

Colloquialisms, proverbs and insults
Many cultures have colloquialisms and proverbs that include donkeys or asses.

 British phrases include "to talk the hind legs off a donkey", used to describe someone talking excessively and generally persuasively.

91 Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as "the donkey lets the rain soak him".

92 The French philosopher Jean Buridan constructed the paradox called Buridan's ass, in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst because he could not find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision.

93 Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including "put your money in the ass of a donkey and they'll call him sir" (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and "women, donkeys and goats all have heads" (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats).

94 The United States developed its own expressions, including "better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me", "a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey", and "a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold", among others.

95 From Afghanistan, we find the Pashto proverb, "Even if a donkey goes to Mecca, he is still a donkey.

" In Ethiopia, there are many Amharic proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, "The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart" (Bad company corrupts good morals).


The words "donkey" and "ass" (or translations thereof) have come to have derogatory or insulting meaning in several languages, and are generally used to mean someone who is obstinate, stupid or silly,96979899 In football, especially in the United Kingdom, a player who is considered unskilful is often dubbed a "donkey",96and the term has a similar connotation in poker.

100 In the US, the slang terms "dumbass" and "jackass" are used to refer to someone considered stupid.

Politics
Satirical use of braying in a political cartoon

The Thomas Nast political cartoon that introduced the donkey as the mascot of the Democratic Party
In keeping with their widespread cultural references, donkeys feature in political systems, symbols and terminology in many areas of the world.

 A "donkey vote" is a vote that simply writes down preferences in the order of the candidates (1 at the top, then 2, and so on), and is most often seen in countries with ranked voting systems and compulsory voting, such as Australia.

103 The donkey is a common symbol of the Democratic Party of the United States, originating in a cartoon by Thomas Nast of Harper's Weekly in the nineteenth century.

104
The bray of the donkey may be used as a simile for loud and foolish speech in political mockery.

105106 For example,107
There are braying men in the world as well as braying asses; for what's loud and senseless talking and swearing, any other than braying

The "ruc catala" or "burro catala" (Catalan donkey) has become a symbol of Catalonia in Spain.

 In 2003 some friends in Catalonia made bumper stickers featuring the burro catala as a reaction against a national advertising campaign for Toro d'Osborne, a brandy.

 The burro became popular as a nationalist symbol in Catalonia, whose residents wanted to assert their identity to resist Spanish centralism.

 Renewed attention to the regional burro helped start a breeding campaign for its preservation, and its numbers have increased.

109
Proshka, an ass owned by Russian populist nationalist liberal democratic politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, became prominent during the 2012 Russian presidential election campaign, when he was filmed in an election advertisement video.

 In that controversial ad, Zhirinovsky appeared sitting in a sleigh harnessed with Proshka, then claiming that the "little wretched ass" is the symbol of Russia and that if he would become President a "daring troika" would return as a symbol of Russia instead of the ass; at the end, Zhirinovsky beat Proshka with a whip, made the ass move and had a ride on him through the snow-covered backyard of his dacha.

 International organisations People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and World Animal Protection have accused Zhirinovsky of cruelty to animals.

 Zhirinovsky replied to the assertions by stating that similar treatment is commonplace in the Arab world and claimed that his ass has been treated "better than many people".


The domestic guinea pig or simply guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia.

 Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea in Africa.

 They originated in the Andes of South America; studies based on biochemistry and hybridizationsuggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as C.

 tschudii, and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild.

12
The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.

3 Guinea pigs are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where they are known as cuy.

 Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.

4
In Western societies, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century.

 Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; and the relative ease of caring for them continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet.

 Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures are cultivated by breeders.


Biological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century.

 The animals were frequently used as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet "guinea pig" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats.

 They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.

History
The guinea pig was first domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America (the present-day southern part of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia),5 some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American camelids.

6 Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador.

7 The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art.

8 From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532, selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds.

9 They continue to be a food source in the region; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal, which subsists on the family's vegetable scraps.

10 Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors.

11 They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or curanderos, who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice, rheumatism, arthritis, and typhus.

12 They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a supernatural medium.

13Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses.

14 The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective.

15 These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted.

16
Spanish, Dutch, and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I.

5 The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers.

1 However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal must have been introduced by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC,17 and it was present in the Ostionoid period, for example, on Puerto Rico,18 long before the advent of the Spaniards.

 The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swissnaturalist Conrad Gessner.

19 Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus' specific conferral (1758).

1 The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting (artist unknown) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell guinea pig in her hands; she is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird.

20 The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England, which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall, an Elizabethan manor house in Essex, and dated to around 1575.

20
Name
The scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus, with porcellus being Latin for "little pig".

 Cavia is New Latin; it is derived from cabiai, the animal's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana.

21 Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese cavia (now savia), which is itself derived from the Tupi word sauja, meaning rat.

22 Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo (plural cuyes, cuyos) in the Spanish of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.

23Ironically, breeders tend to use the more formal "cavy" to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts, it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial "guinea pig".

24
How the animals came to be called "pigs" is not clear.

 They are built somewhat like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating.

2425 They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.

24
The animal's name alludes to pigs in many European languages.

 The German word for them is Meerschweinchen, literally "little sea pig", which has been translated into Polish as .
winka morska, into Hungarian as tengerimalac, and into Russian as .
 .

 This derives from the Middle High German name merswin.

 This originally meant "dolphin" and was used because of the animals' grunting sounds (which were thought to be similar).

26 Many other, possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist.

 For example, sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat.

 The French term is cochon d'Inde (Indian pig) or cobaye; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje (Guinean piglet) or cavia (while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat); and in Portuguese, the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia, from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as porquinho da India (little Indian pig).

 This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias (little rabbit of the Indies).

23 The Chinese refer to them as ³b¹« (tunsh.
, 'pig mouse'), and sometimes as Netherlands pig (²üÄõ½Þ, helanzh.
) or Indian mouse (¤ÑªÇ¹«, ti.
nzhush.
).

 The Japanese word for guinea pig is "" (morumotto), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the marmot; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843.


The origin of "guinea" in "guinea pig" is harder to explain.

 One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there.

24 "Guinea" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal.

2728 Another hypothesis suggests the "guinea" in the name is a corruption of "Guiana", an area in South America.

2729 A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term "Ginny-pig" as early as 1653.

30 Others believe "guinea" may be an alteration of the word coney (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as "pig coneys" in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.

Traits and environment
Main article: List of guinea pig breeds

Two parti-colored Abyssinian guinea pigs
Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 700 and 1,200 g (1.

5 and 2.

6 lb), and measuring between 20 and 25 cm (8 and 10 in) in length.

31 Modern breeding of cuy guinea pigs has resulted in animals weighing 6 pounds (2.

7 kg).

32 They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years.

33 According to the 2006 Guinness World Records, the longest living guinea pig survived 14 years, 10.

5 months.

34
In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents and should be reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs).

3536 Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as monophyletic is justified.

3738
Natural habitat
C.

 porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from some closely related species of cavies, such as C.

 aperea, C.

 fulgida, and C.

 tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America.

1 Studies from 2007¡V2010 applied molecular markers3940and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals,41 thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii.

 Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as C.

 anolaimae and C.

 guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild.

9 Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle.

 They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups).

 They move together in groups (herds) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food.

42 While they do not burrow or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation.

42 They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk, when it is harder for predators to spot them.

43
Domestic habitat
Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations.

 Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females.

44 Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present.

45 Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between.

43 Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.

43

This cat has accepted this pair of guinea pigs.

 The success of this type of interspecies interaction varies according to the individual animals involved.


Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets.

 Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot (ulcerative pododermatitis).

46 "Cubes and Coroplast" (or C&C) style cages are now a common choice.

47 Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material.

 Bedding made from red cedar (Eastern or Western) and pine, both softwoods, were commonly used in the past, but these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils.

48 Safer beddings made from hardwoods (such as aspen), paper products, and corn cob materials are other alternatives.

48 Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove.

49 After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory.

50 Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.


Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species.

 Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbilsand hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections,51 and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig.

52 Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) can be trained to accept them.

53 Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits.

 Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage.

5354 However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food.

55 Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible.

56 Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.

57
Behavior
Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months.

 Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion.

58 While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, most of them are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile.

 They startle extremely easily, and either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger.

43 Larger groups of startled guinea pigs "stampede", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators.

59 When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as "popcorning"), a movement analogous to the ferret's war dance.

60 They are also very good swimmers.

61

Guinea pigs "social groom"
Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom.

62 A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process.

63 Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture.

61 Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), piloerection, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks.

64Non-sexual simulated mounting for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.


Guinea pig sight is not as good as that of a human, but they have a wider angle of vision (about 340¢X) and see in partial color (dichromacy).

 They have well-developed senses of hearing, smell, and touch.

6566 Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.

67 These are the most common sounds made by the guinea pig:68
	A "wheek" is a loud noise, the name of which is onomatopoeic, also known as a whistle.

	 An expression of general excitement, it may occur in response to the presence of its owner or to feeding.

	 It is sometimes used to find other guinea pigs if they are running.

	 If a guinea pig is lost, it may wheek for assistance.

	  listen (help¡Pinfo)
	A bubbling or purring sound is made when the guinea pig is enjoying itself, such as when being petted or held.

	 It may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food.

	  listen (help¡Pinfo)
	A rumbling sound is normally related to dominance within a group, though it can also come as a response to being scared or angry.

	 In these cases, the rumble often sounds higher and the body vibrates shortly.

	 While courting, a male usually purrs deeply, swaying and circling the female69 in a behavior called "rumblestrutting".

	 A low rumble while walking away reluctantly shows passive resistance.

	  listen (help¡Pinfo)
	Chutting and whining are sounds made in pursuit situations, by the pursuer and pursuee, respectively.

	  listen (help¡Pinfo)
	A chattering sound is made by rapidly gnashing the teeth, and is generally a sign of warning.

	 Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.

	
	Squealing or shrieking is a high-pitched sound of discontent, in response to pain or danger.

	  listen (help¡Pinfo)
	Chirping, a less-common sound, likened to bird song, seems to be related to stress, or when a baby guinea pig wants to be fed.

	 Very rarely, the chirping will last for several minutes.

Breeding

Pregnant sow one week before delivering three pups
The guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; as many as five litters can be produced per year.

9 The gestation period lasts from 59¡V72 days, with an average of 63¡V68 days.

50 Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies.

 Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight;61 they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle.

 Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three;70 the largest recorded litter size is 17.

71 The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.

7273
In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour due to oversized pups.

 Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns.

74 Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.

75
Guinea pigs also practice alloparental care, in which a female may adopt the pup or pups of another.

 This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them.

 This behavior is common, and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant.

76
Male and female guinea pigs do not differ in external appearance apart from general size.

 The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes.

 Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair.

77 The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.

Males reach sexual maturity at 3¡V5 weeks; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults.

78 Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age.

50:7379 If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt to give birth.

80 Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth.

 The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis.

 A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.

81 Females can become pregnant 6¡V48 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be thus constantly pregnant.

82
Toxemia of pregnancy is common and kills many pregnant females.

 Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases.

83 Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates.

84 Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.

85
Diet

Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet.

 Their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life.

86 Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces.

87 However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion.

5588 The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese.

55 They share this behaviour with rabbits.

 In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak.

 This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass.

89 The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.


Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy.

 Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it,1090 though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs.

 Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs.

9192 However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.

938894
Like humans, but unlike most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food.

 If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy.

 Guinea pigs require about 10 mg of vitamin C daily (20 mg if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements.

95 Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary.

96 Imbalanced diets have been associated with muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems.

9798 Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity.

8899 They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types.

61 A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present.

100 Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely gnaw, lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents.

47 Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.


A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), and wild celery.

101 Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.

g.

, tulip or onion) is normally considered poisonous,102 as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.


Health

Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), abscesses due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by lice, mites, or fungus.

103
Mange mites (Trixacarus caviae) are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and, in some instances, seizures.

104 Guinea pigs may also suffer from "running lice" (Gliricola porcelli), a small, white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; their eggs, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as "static lice".

 Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as ovarian cysts.

105
Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer.

106 Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing.

 While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes.

 Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.

107
Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat.

108 Its normal body temperature is 101¡V104 ¢XF (38¡V40 ¢XC),109 so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about 65¡V75 ¢XF (18¡V24 ¢XC).

108 Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90 ¢XF (32 ¢XC) have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows.

108 Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts,110 and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30¡V70%.

111
Guinea pigs are prey animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages.

 Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.

112113
Similar to the inherited genetic diseases of other breeds of animal (such as hip dysplasia in canines), a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported.

 Most commonly, the roan coloration of Abyssinian guinea pigs is associated with congenital eye disorders and problems with the digestive system.

114 Other genetic disorders include "waltzing disease" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), palsy, and tremor conditions.

115

Handling, temperament and socialization
If handled correctly early in life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch.

61 They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself.

54 Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain.

 Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored.

 In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.

116
Appearance, coat and grooming

Black-haired Silkie Guinea pig
Domesticated guinea pigs occur in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America.

 These varieties vary in hair and color composition.

 The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes.

 Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair.

 Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes.

 Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.

117
Clubs and associations
Cavy clubs and associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide.

 The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders' Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada.

118 The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.

 Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council)119 and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Council).

120 Each club publishes its own standard of perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.


Allergies to pet guinea pigs
Allergic symptoms, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, have been documented in laboratory animal workers who come into contact with guinea pigs.

121122Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported.

121 Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander.

121 People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well.

123 Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.


Cultural and media influence

A lilac, orange, and white Satin Peruvian guinea pig (show-length coat)
As a result of their widespread popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media.

 Some noted appearances of the animal in literature include the short story "Pigs Is Pigs" by Ellis Parker Butler, which is a tale of bureaucratic incompetence.

 Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are "pigs" or "pets" for the purpose of determining freight charges.

124 Butler's story, in turn, inspired the Star Trek: The Original Series episode "The Trouble With Tribbles", written by David Gerrold.

125 In the Golden Hamster Sagabooks, two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso are modern-day thespians (named after Enrico Caruso) who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, Freddy Auratus, who strongly dislikes their acting antics.


In children's literature
The Fairy Caravan, a novel by Beatrix Potter,126 and Michael Bond's Olga da Polga series for children,127 both feature guinea pigs as the protagonist.

 Another appearance is in The Magician's Nephew by C.

 S.

 Lewis: in the first (chronologically) of his The Chronicles of Narnia series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the Wood between the Worlds.

128 In Ursula Dubosarsky's Maisie and the Pinny Gig, a little girl has a recurrent dream about a giant guinea pig, while guinea pigs feature significantly in several of Dubosarsky's other books, including the young adult novel The White Guinea Pig and The Game of the Goose.

129
In film and television
Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television.

 In the TV movie Shredderman Rules, the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which play a minor part in the plot.

 A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by Chris Rock, was a prominent character in the 1998 film Dr.

 Dolittle, and Linny the Guinea pig is a co-star on Nick Jr.

's Wonder Pets.

 Guinea pigs were used in some major advertising campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for Egg Banking plc,130 Snapple, and Blockbuster Video.

131 The Blockbuster campaign is considered by some guinea pig advocates to have been a factor in the rise of caging guinea pigs and rabbits together.

57 In the South Park season 12 episode "Pandemic 2: The Startling", giant guinea pigs dressed in costumes rampage over the Earth.

132 The 2009 Walt Disney Pictures movie G-Force features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.

S.

 government.

 A video game based on the movie was also released.

 A guinea pig named Bugsy appears in the 2008 film Bedtime Stories.

 A guinea pig named Cashew features prominently in the second season of the U.

S.

 adaptation of House of Cards.


Scientific research

The use of guinea pigs in scientific experimentation dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighiand Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures.

133 In 1780, Antoine Lavoisierused a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production.

 The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning.

134 Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Emile Roux, and Robert Koch.

135 Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 ¡V with a successful recovery.

136 China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.

137
In English, the term 'guinea pig' is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times.

 This dates back to the early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913.

138In 1933, Consumers Research founders F.

 J.

 Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society.

139 The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement.

140 The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludvik Vaculik as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism.

141 Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century; about 2.

5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.

S.

 for research in the 1960s,142 but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s.

61 As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals.

142 In the past, they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis.

143 Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation.

143 Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats.

 This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W.

 E.

 Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color.

115144 In 2004, the U.

S.

's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig.

145
The guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases.

143 Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus.

143 They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria.

142 Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C, but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy.

142 From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the "ascorbutic factor" in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.

146147
Complement, an important component for serology, was first isolated from the blood of the guinea pig.

142 Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation,148 and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies.

149 Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone.

150 Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females.

75 Their placental structure is similar to that of humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.

151
Guinea pig strains used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains.

 Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available.

152 Inbred strains are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology.

 Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, "Strain 2" and "Strain 13".

115152
Hairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for dermatological studies.

 A hairless and immunodeficient breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1979.

153 An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the Institute Armand Frappier in 1978, and Charles River Laboratories has reproduced this breed for research since 1982.

154Cavy fanciers then began acquiring hairless breeds, and the pet hairless varieties are referred to as "skinny pigs".


As food

South America
Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curi) were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes.

 Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people.

155 It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia.

156 Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle;157 moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment.

 Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.

158 Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken.

4159 The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee.

160 Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish.

160 Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.

160
Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the Last Supper in the main cathedral in Cusco shows Christ and the 12 disciples dining on guinea pig.

4The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru.

 A religious celebration known as jaca tsariy ("collecting the cuys") is a major festival in many villages in the Antonio Raimondi province of eastern Peru, and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in Lima.

161 It is a syncretistic event, combining elements of Catholicismand pre-Columbian religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local patron saints.

5 The exact form the jaca tsariy takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a sirvinti (servant) is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock bullfight.

5Meals such as cuy chactado are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic satire of local politicians or important figures.

5 In the Tungurahua and Cotopaxi provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of Corpus Christi as part of the Ensayo, which is a community meal, and the Octava, where castillos (greased poles) are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung.

162 The Peruvian town of Churin has an annual festival which involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for a competition.

163
Andean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy.

164 Peruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental programs in the 1960s with the intention of breeding larger-sized guinea pigs.

165 Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable.

166 In the 1990s and 2000s, the university began exporting the larger breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of these countries in northern South America.

Sub-Saharan Africa
Many efforts have also been made to promote guinea pig husbandry in developing countries of West Africa,157 where they occur more widely than generally known because they are usually not covered by livestock statistics.

 However, it has not been known when and where the animals have been introduced to Africa.

167 In Cameroon, they are widely distributed.

168169 In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they can be found both in peri-urban environments170 as well as in rural regions, for example, in South Kivu.

171172 They are also frequently held in rural households in Iringa Region of southwestern Tanzania.


The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl.

 It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011.

1 Humans commonly keep chickens as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.


Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast Asia, East Asia,2 and South Asia, but with the cladefound in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.

 From India, the domesticated chicken was imported to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the fifth century BC.

3 Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

Terminology

Didactic model of a chicken.


In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Australia and Canada they are more commonly called roosters.

 Males less than a year old are cockerels.

7 Castratedroosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world).

 Females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets8 although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age.

 In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.

9 The young are called chicks and the meat is called chicken.


"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.

10 The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl.

 This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).

 The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation.


In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.

11
General biology and habitat

Anatomy of a chicken.



In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb
Chickens are omnivores.

12 In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes or young mice.

13
Chickens may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.

14 The world's oldest chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 according to Guinness World Records.

15
Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed.

 However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's.

 The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).

 Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.

 Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.

 Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.

 A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.

 Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).

 Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.


Behavior
Social behaviour

Hen with chicks, India.



Hen with chicks, Portugal.


Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks.

 They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.

 Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations.

 Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.

 Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.

16 When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first.

 He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.

 This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.


A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.

citation neededHowever, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

 Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks.

 Chickens also give a low "warning call" when they sense a predator approaching.

To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.

17 The dance triggers a response in the hen17 and when she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.


More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1.

 Male approaching the hen.

 2.

 Male pre-copulatory waltzing.

 3.

 Male Waltzing.

 4.

 Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate).

 5.

 Male Mounting.

 6.

 Male treading with both feet on hen¡¦s back.

 7.

 Male tail bending (following successful copulation).

Nesting and laying behaviour

Chicken eggs vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) (Araucana varieties).



Chicks before their first outing
Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own.

 The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.

 Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location.

 It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time.

 If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.

 There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.

19 Some farmers use fake eggs made from plastic or stone (or golf balls) to encourage hens to lay in a particular location.


Broodiness
Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs.

 Many domestic hens will also do this¡Vand are then said to "go broody".

 The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs).

 She will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe.

 While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation.

 To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest.

 To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.

Modern egg-laying breeds rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation.

 However, some "utility" (general purpose) breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species¡Xeven those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, turkeys or geese.

 Chicken eggs can also be hatched under a broody duck, with varied success.


Hatching and early life
Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.

17 Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.

 Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells.

 The chick begins by "pipping"; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.

 The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).

 The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.

 The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest.


Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac.

 Some commercial breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.

20 Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night.

 She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly.

 She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.


Embryology

Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo
In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds "turned on" a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils.

 John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have ".

Breeding
Origins

Male red junglefowl.


The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and is scientifically classified as the same species.

22 As such it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red jungle fowl.

22 Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G.

 sonneratii).

23
The traditional poultry farming view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe, rather than for egg or meat production.

 In the last decade there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins.

 According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of Thailandgave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.

24 However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the Indian subcontinent, where a large number of unique haplotypes occur.

2526 It is postulated that the jungle fowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special pheasant well adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year bamboo seeding cycle to boost its own reproduction.

27 In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the jungle fowl when exposed to large amounts of food.

28
It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.

29 However a recent study,30 raises doubts as to whether those birds were the ancestors of chickens today.

 Instead, the origin could be the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley.

 Eventually, the chicken moved to the Tarim basin of central Asia.

 The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.

31 Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC.

 Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia.

 Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages.

31 Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.

32
Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in Syria; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC.

 They reached Egypt for purposes of cock fighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC).

31 Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa.

 Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara.

 The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.

31
Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.

31
A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.

31
South America
An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people.

 Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs.

 It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America.

 In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile.

 Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.

33 These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.

34
However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:
A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America.

 In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal.

 Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.

Farming

36
More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.

37 In the US alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,38 and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.

39
The vast majority of poultry is raised in factory farms.

 According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.

40 One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free range farming.


Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism.

 Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.

41 Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.

42
In part due to the conditions on intensive poultry farms and recent recalls of large quantities of eggs, there is a growing movement for small-scale micro-flocks or 'backyard chickens'.

 This involves keeping small numbers of hens (usually no more than a dozen) in suburban or urban residential areas to control bugs, to utilize chicken waste as fertilizer in small gardens, and for the high-quality eggs and meat that are produced.


Reared for meat
Main article: Broiler

A commercial chicken house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat
Chickens farmed for meat are called broiler chickens.

 Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broilers typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size.

43 A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age.


Reared for eggs
Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens.

 In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.

44 Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with "the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days".

45 After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable.

 Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.

46 In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as "soup hens".

46 In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying.

 This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7¡V14 days47 or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,48 or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.

49 This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also re-invigorates egg-production.

 Some flocks may be force-moulted several times.

 In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.

50
Artificial incubation

An egg incubator
Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.

5152 The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator.

 Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch.

 Variations of more than 1 ¢XC (1.

8 ¢XF) from the optimum temperature of 37.

5 ¢XC (99.

5 ¢XF) will reduce hatch rates.

 Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity.

 Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss.

 Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell.

 Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation.

 The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates.

 For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching.

 If the eggs aren't turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects.

 Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen.

 Older eggs require increased ventilation.


Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process.

 Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.


As pets
Main article: Chickens as pets
Some people find chickens' behaviour entertaining and educational53 and may keep them as pets.

54 Chickens can be tamed by hand feeding,55 although roosters can sometimes become aggressive and noisy.

 Aggression may be curbed with proper handling.

 Some have advised against keeping them around very young childrencitation needed.

 Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.

56
Diseases and ailments
Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases.

 Despite the name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted to humans.

57

Vatican Persian Cock ¡X A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican (Holy See) in Rome dating to 600 CE.

 Notice the halo denoting the status of being holy in that religious schema.


Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures60 and deeply embedded within belief systems and religious worship.

 The term "Persian bird" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact "because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians".

61
In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during the Hindu cremation ceremony.

 A chicken is considered a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony.

 A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members.

 The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.


In ancient Greece, the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal.

 Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of Ares, Heracles, and Athena.

 The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning, as recounted by Plato, were "Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.


The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters.

 Several of Aesop's Fables reference this belief.


In the New Testament, Jesus prophesied the betrayal by Peter: "Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.

'"62 It happened,63 and Peter cried bitterly.

 This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.


Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about Jerusalem: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.

"64
In the sixth century, Pope Gregory I declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity65 and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by Pope Nicholas I60 ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.

66
In many Central European folk tales, the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.


In traditional Jewish practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called kapparos; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head.

 A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold).

 The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos.

 The meat is then donated to the poor.

 A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster.

 Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.


The Talmud speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's mate" from the rooster.

67 This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.

 A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked.

 The Talmud likewise provides us with the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks",6869 which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins" (Young's Literal Translation) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" in the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31 as referenced by Michael V.

 Fox in his Proverbs 10-31 where Sa.
adiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of "A cock girded about the loins" in Proverbs 30:31 (Douay¡VRheims Bible) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",70identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.


The chicken is one of the symbols of the Chinese Zodiac.

 In Chinese folk religion, a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities.

 Vegetarian deities such as the Buddha are not recipients of such offerings.

 Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with "serious" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration).

 In Confucian Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.

g.

, sudden death) to attend the ceremony.

 A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed.

 However, this practice is rare today.


A cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's call.


In history

The red junglefowl
An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages).

 Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,71 the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.

72
The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.

7374 The poet Cratinus(mid-5th century BC, according to the later Greek author Athenaeus) calls the chicken "the Persian alarm".

 In Aristophanes's comedy The Birds (414 BC) a chicken is called "the Median bird", which points to an introduction from the East.

 Pictures of chickens are found on Greek red figure and black-figure pottery.


In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia.

citation needed Delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, De Re Rustica 8.

3.

4).


The Romans used chickens for oracles, both when flying ("ex avibus", Augury) and when feeding ("auspicium ex tripudiis", Alectryomancy).

 The hen ("gallina") gave a favourable omen ("auspicium ratum"), when appearing from the left (Cic.

, de Div.

 ii.

26), like the crow and the owl.


For the oracle "ex tripudiis" according to Cicero (Cic.

 de Div.

 ii.

34), any bird could be used in auspice, and shows at one point that any bird could perform the tripudium75 but normally only chickens ("pulli") were consulted.

 The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed.

 If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises ("occinerent"), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.

76
In 249 BC, the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his "sacred chickens" "77 thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of Drepana, saying "If they won't eat, perhaps they will drink.

" He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk.

 Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.

78
In 162 BC, the Lex Faunia forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.

7980 To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters (capon), which resulted in a doubling of size81 despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens.

 It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful.

 Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results.

 The Roman gourmet Apicius offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce.

 All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the stomach, liver, testicles and even the pygostyle (the fatty "tail" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).


The Roman author Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, De Re Rustica (On Agriculture).

 He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the Greeks (De Re Rustica 8.

3.

 For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (De Re Rustica 8.

 Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.


According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.

2.

7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals.

 White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks.

 One cock should be kept for five hens.

 In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock.

 The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens.

 A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings.

 Eggs that are long and pointed give more male, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (De Re Rustica 8.

5.

11).


Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and "poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke" (De Re Rustica 8.

3.

1).

82 Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth.

 Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.


According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.

4.

1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap.

 Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds.

 Boiled ryegrass (Lolium sp.

) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.

) can be used as well.

 Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few.

 When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran.

 Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February.

 Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand.

 Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.


Columellacitation needed advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, because they no longer produce sufficient eggs.


According to Aldrovandi: Capons were produced by burning "the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs"83 with a hot iron.

 The wound was treated with potter's chalk.

Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans).

 They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also "expressed his doubts about this".

As food
Main article: Chicken as food
The meat of the chicken, also called "chicken", is a type of poultry meat.

 Because of its relatively low cost, chicken is one of the most used meats in the world.

 Nearly all parts of the bird can be used for food, and the meat can be cooked in many different ways.

 Popular chicken dishes include roasted chicken, fried chicken, chicken soup, Buffalo wings, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and chicken rice.

 Chicken is also a staple of many fast food restaurants.


In the Caribbean there is a species of large frog known as a mountain chicken as it is large, and tastes like chicken.

 Consequently it is an endangered species.

1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.

4 billion hens.

87
Chicken eggs are widely used in many types of dishes, both sweet and savory, including many baked goods.

 Eggs can be scrambled, fried, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, pickled, and poached.

 The albumen, or egg white, contains protein but little or no fat, and can be used in cooking separately from the yolk.

 Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light, fluffy consistency and are often used in desserts such as meringues and mousse.

 Ground egg shells are sometimes used as a food additive to deliver calcium.

 Hens do not need a male to produce eggs, only to fertilize them.

 A flock containing only females will still produce eggs; however, the eggs will all be infertile.


The horse (Equus ferus caballus).
2.
.
3.
 is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
 It is an odd-toed ungulate mammalbelonging to the taxonomic family Equidae.
 The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.
 Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.
 Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.
 These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse.
 There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balanceand a strong fight-or-flight response.
 Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down.
 Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth.
 Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four.
 They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe.
 There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.

Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy.
 Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control.
 Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.
 Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.

Specific terms and specialized language are used to describe equine anatomy, different life stages, colors and breeds.

Lifespan and life stages
Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.
.
6.
 Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.
.
7.
 The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.
.
6.
 In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.
.
8.

Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere.
6.
.
9.
 and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere.
.
10.
 The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.
.
11.

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:
	Colt: A male horse under the age of four.
	.
	12.
	 A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.
	.
	13.
	
	Filly: A female horse under the age of four.
	.
	14.
	
	Foal: A horse of either sex less than one year old.
	 A nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling.
	.
	14.
	 Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.
	.
	15.
	
	Gelding: A castrated male horse of any age.
	.
	14.
	
	Mare: A female horse four years old and older.
	.
	16.
	
	Stallion: A non-castrated male horse four years old and older.
	.
	17.
	 The term "horse" is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.
	.
	18.
	
	Yearling: A horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.
	.
	19.
	
In horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.
.
20.
However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.
.
21.

Size and measurement
The height of horses is usually measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back.
.
22.
 This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.

In English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to 4 inches (101.
6 mm).
 The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high").
 Thus, a horse described as "15.
2 h" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches (157.
5 cm) in height.
.
23.


Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and small pony.

The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition.
 Light riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands (56 to 64 inches, 142 to 163 cm) and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms (840 to 1,210 lb).
.
24.
 Larger riding horses usually start at about 15.
2 hands (62 inches, 157 cm) and often are as tall as 17 hands (68 inches, 173 cm), weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms (1,100 to 1,320 lb).
.
25.
 Heavy or draft horsesare usually at least 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high and can be as tall as 18 hands (72 inches, 183 cm) high.
 They can weigh from about 700 to 1,000 kilograms (1,540 to 2,200 lb).
.
26.

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848.
 He stood 21.
2 1?4 hands (86.
25 inches, 219 cm) high and his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms (3,360 lb).
.
27.
 The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism.
 She is 17 in (43 cm) tall and weighs 57 lb (26 kg).
.
28.

Ponies
Main article: Pony
Ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses.
 The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes.
 However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.

The traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is 14.
2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm).
 An animal 14.
2 h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.
2 h a pony,.
29.
 but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard.
 In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm).
.
30.
 For competition in the Western division of the United States Equestrian Federation, the cutoff is 14.
1 hands (57 inches, 145 cm).
.
31.
 The International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than 148 centimetres (58.
27 in) at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.
2 h, and 149 centimetres (58.
66 in), or just over 14.
2? h, with shoes.
.
32.

Height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies.
 Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.
2 h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.
.
33.
 Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.
2 h, but are still considered to be ponies.
.
34.

Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat.
 They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads.
 They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.
.
29.
 Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant.
 For example, the Shetland pony which averages 10 hands (40 inches, 102 cm), is considered a pony.
.
29.
 Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than 30 inches (76 cm), are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.
.
35.

Genetics
Horses have 64 chromosomes.
.
36.
 The horse genome was sequenced in 2007.
 It contains 2.
7 billion DNA base pairs,.
37.
 which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome.
.
38.
 The map is available to researchers.
.
39.

Colors and markings

Bay (left) and chestnut (sometimes called "sorrel") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds.

Main articles: Equine coat color, Equine coat color genetics, and Horse markings
Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary.
 Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.
.
40.
 Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings,.
41.
 which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.
.
42.

Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified.
 Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color,.
43.
 and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits.
 The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor,.
44.
 also known as the "extension gene" or "red factor,".
43.
 as its recessive form is "red" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black.
.
45.
 Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as graying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.
.
43.

Horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks "white" is usually a middle-aged or older gray.
 Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings).
 The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.
.
45.
 Different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene.
.
46.
 However, there are no "albino" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.
.
47.

Reproduction and development
Main article: Horse breeding
Gestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320¡V370 days,.
48.
 and usually results in one foal; twins are rare.
.
49.
 Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.
.
50.
 Foals are usually born in the spring.
 The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19¡V22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn.
 Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.
.
51.
 Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.
.
52.

Horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.
.
53.
 Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care.
 Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone.
 These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.
.
54.

Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four.
.
55.
 Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries,.
56.
 horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.
.
57.
 For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.
.

Anatomy
Main articles: Equine anatomy, Muscular system of the horse, Respiratory system of the horse, and Circulatory system of the horse
Skeletal system
Main article: Skeletal system of the horse

The skeletal system of a modern horse
The horse skeleton averages 205 bones.
.
58.
 A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone¡Xthe horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso.
 The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures.
 Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human.
 For example, the body part that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist.
 Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel.
 The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpalor metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human.
 A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.
.
59.

Hooves
Main articles: Horse hoof, Horseshoe, and Farrier
The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".
.
60.
 The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae.
 The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail.
.
61.
 The end result is that a horse, weighing on average 500 kilograms (1,100 lb),.
62.
 travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.
.
63.
 For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier.
 The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,.
64.
though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.

Teeth
Main article: Horse teeth
Horses are adapted to grazing.
 In an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation.
 There are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth.
 Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called "tushes".
 Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit.
 There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or "bars" of the horse's mouth when the horse is bridled.
.
65.

An estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth.
 The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing.
 Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet.
 This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.
.
6.

Digestion
Main articles: Equine digestive system and Equine nutrition
Horses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day.
 Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients.
 A 450-kilogram (990 lb) horse will eat 7 to 11 kilograms (15 to 24 lb) of food per day and, under normal use, drink 38 to 45 litres (8.
4 to 9.
9 imp gal; 10 to 12 US gal) of water.
 Horses are not ruminants, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize cellulose, a major component of grass.
 Horses are hindgut fermenters.
 Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the cecum, or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine.
 Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death.
.
66.

Senses

A horse's eye
See also: Equine vision
The horses' senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.
.
67.
They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,.
68.
 and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.
.
69.
 This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350¢X, with approximately 65¢X of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285¢X monocular vision.
.
68.
 Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.
.
70.

Their sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog.
 It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment.
 Horses have two olfactory centers.
 The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors.
 The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs.
 These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.
.
71.

A horse's hearing is good,.
67.
 and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180¢X, giving the potential for 360¢X hearing without having to move the head.
.
72.
 Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music.
 This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels.
.
73.
 An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.
.
74.

Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception¡Xthe unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times.
.
75.
 A horse's sense of touch is well developed.
 The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose.
.
76.
 Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.
.
77.

Horses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat,.
78.
 and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains.
 Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.
.

Canter 16-27 km/h
 
	
Galop 25-30 km/h
Main articles: Horse gait, Trot (horse gait), Canter, and Ambling
All horses move naturally with four basic gaits: the four-beat walk, which averages 6.
4 kilometres per hour (4.
0 mph); the two-beat trot or jog at 13 to 19 kilometres per hour (8.
1 to 11.
8 mph) (faster for harness racing horses); the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is 19 to 24 kilometres per hour (12 to 15 mph); and the gallop.
.
80.
 The gallop averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph),.
81.
 but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 70.
76 kilometres per hour (43.
97 mph).
.
82.
 Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot.
.
83.
 There also are several four-beat "ambling" gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride.
 These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tolt as well as the diagonal fox trot.
.
84.
 Ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses.
.
85.
 Often, gaited horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.
.
86.

Behavior
Main articles: Horse behavior and Stable vices
Horses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response.
 Their first reaction to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.
.
87.
 They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening.
 Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors.
 However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.
.
88.

Horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare.
 They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans.
 They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language.
 Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.
.
89.
 However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.
.
90.

Intelligence and learning
Studies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system.
 They also have good spatial discrimination abilities.
.
91.
 Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory.
 Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning.
 They can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement.
.
91.
 One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between "more or less" if the quantity involved is less than four.
.
92.

Domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural.
.
91.
 Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently.
 One trainer believes that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.
.
93.

Temperament
Main articles: Draft horse, Warmblood, and Oriental horse
Horses are mammals, and as such are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals.
 However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature.
 For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy,.
94.
 while the "cold-bloods", such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer.
.
95.
 Sometimes "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses",.
96.
 with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".
.
97.


Illustration of assorted breeds; slim, light hotbloods, medium-sized warmbloods and draft and pony-type coldblood breeds
"Hot blooded" breeds include "oriental horses" such as the Akhal-Teke, Arabian horse, Barb and now-extinct Turkoman horse, as well as the Thoroughbred, a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds.
.
94.
 Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly.
 They are bred for agility and speed.
.
98.
They tend to be physically refined¡Xthin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.
.
99.
 The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.
.
100.
.
101.

Muscular, heavy draft horses are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.
.
95.
 They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".
.
102.
 Well-known draft breeds include the Belgian and the Clydesdale.
.
102.
 Some, like the Percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.
.
103.
 Others, such as the Shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.
.
104.
 The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.
.
105.

"Warmblood" breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.
.
106.
 Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.
.
107.
 Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".
.
96.

Today, the term "Warmblood" refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping.
.
108.
 Strictly speaking, the term "warm blood" refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.
.

 Examples include breeds such as the Irish Draught or the Cleveland Bay.
 The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the Morgan horse.

Sleep patterns
See also: Horse sleep patterns and Sleep in non-humans

When horses lie down to sleep, others in the herd remain standing, awake or in a light doze, keeping watch.

Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down.
 In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a "stay apparatus" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.
.
110.
 Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators.
 A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.
.
111.

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest.
 Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down.
 Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,.
111.
 mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each.
.
112.
 The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.
9 hours per day.
.
113.

Horses must lie down to reach REM sleep.
 They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.
.
111.
 However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.
.
114.
 This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.

Taxonomy and evolution

From left to right: Size development, biometrical changes in the cranium, reduction of toes (left forefoot)
Main articles: Evolution of the horse, Equus (genus), and Equidae
The horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystemwhere other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not.
.
116.
 Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period.
 In the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three¡XEquidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)¡Xhave survived to the present day.
.
117.

The earliest known member of the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the Eocene period.
 It had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot.
.
118.
 The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37 million years ago.
.
119.
 Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished.
 All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee,.
120.
 known informally as splint bones.
.
121.
 Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed.
.
120.
 By about 5 million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved.
.
122.
 Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses.
 Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.

By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a widespread holarctic species.
 Horse bones from this time period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America.
.
123.
 Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere.
.
124.
.
125.
.
126.
 The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival.
.
127.
 Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.
.
128.

Wild species surviving into modern times

A small herd of Przewalski's Horses
Main article: Wild horse
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated.
 Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.
.
129.
 Only two never-domesticated subspecies, the Tarpan and the Przewalski's Horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.

The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), named after the Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal.
 It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people call it a kirtag.
 The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world.
 In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.
.
130.
 Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.
.
131.
.
132.
 There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.

The tarpan or European wild horse (Equus ferus ferus) was found in Europe and much of Asia.
 It survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo.
.
133.
 Thus, the genetic line was lost.
 Attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan,.
133.
.
134.
.
135.
 which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.

Periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic.
 For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such,.
132.
 but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses.
.
136.
 Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics,.
137.
.
138.
 but genetic studies have shown that the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.
.
137.
.
139.

Other modern equids
Main article: Equus (genus)
Besides the horse, there are seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family.
 These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the mountain zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grevy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.
.
140.

Horses can crossbreed with other members of their genus.
 The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a mare.
 A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a jenny (female donkey).
.
141.
 Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse.
.
142.
 With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.
.
143.

Domestication
Main articles: History of horse domestication theories and Domestication of the horse

Bhimbetka rock painting showing man riding on horse, India
Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC.
 Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world.
 The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.

The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500¡V4000 BC.
.
144.
.
145.
.
146.
 By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.
.
147.
 The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c.
 2100 BC.
.
148.

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations.
 The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse,.
149.
.
150.
 while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.
.
139.
.
151.
.
152.
 This is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA).
 There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability,.
149.
.
150.
 but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA.
.
139.
.
151.
.
152.
 There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds.
.
139.
.
151.
.
152.
.
153.
 Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation.
.
154.
 In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.
.
155.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed.
 One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.
.
105.
 Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication.
.
156.
 However, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.

Feral populations
Main article: Feral horse
Feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals.
.
129.
 Many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world.
.
157.
.
158.
Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses,.
159.
 as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.
.
160.

There are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as Dartmoor and the New Forest in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in "wild" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands.
 Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.
.
161.
.
162.

Breeds
Main articles: Horse breed, List of horse breeds, and Horse breeding
The concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times.
 Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds".
 Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry.
.
163.
 Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition.
 These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selectionmethods.
 Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication.
 An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.
.
164.
 These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition.
.
165.
 In the 14th century, Carthusian monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the Andalusian horse.
.
166.

Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.
.
167.
 Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage.
.
167.
 Heavy draft horses developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons.
.
168.
 Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.
.
169.
 Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock.
 One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed.
.
170.
 There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.
.
171.

Interaction with humans

Equine hospital in the United Kingdom
Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia.
 Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes.
 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania.
 There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.
.
172.
 The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.
.
173.
 In a 2004 "poll" conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.
.
174.

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;.
175.
 to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.
.
176.
 Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,.
177.
 and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.
.
178.
 Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.
.
179.

Sport

Main articles: Equestrianism, Horse racing, Horse training, and Horse tack
Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races.
 Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle.
 Many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider.
 Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations.
 Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.
.
175.
 Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers.
 All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport.
 The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.
.
175.

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions.
 Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting.
.
180.
 Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world.
 They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as "In-hand" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation.
 The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.
.
181.
 Sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game.
 Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions¡Xbe it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.
.
182.
 Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,.
183.
 and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.
.
182.

Horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world.
 There are three types: "flat" racing; steeplechasing, i.
e.
 racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky.
.
184.
 A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.
.
185.

Work

There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them.
 For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.
.
186.
 Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain.
.
187.
 Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.
.
188.
 Horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves.
 They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas.
 Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles.
 Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.
.
189.


Tanga (carriage) at Darbhanga Bihar
Although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100 million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas.
 This number includes around 27 million working animals in Africa alone.
.
190.
 Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses.
 In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animalssuch as horses.
.
191.
.
192.
 Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.
.
193.

Entertainment and culture

See also: Horses in art and Horse worship
Modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes.
 Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles.
.
194.
 Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes.
 Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events.
.
195.
 Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.
.
196.

Horses are frequently seen in television, films and literature.
 They are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories.
.
197.
 Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products.
.
198.
 The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment.
.
199.
 The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun.
.
200.
 The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.
.
201.

Therapeutic use
See also: Hippotherapy and Therapeutic horseback riding
People of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses.
 Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.
.
202.
 The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Gamesand recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI).
.
203.
 Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement.
 In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.
.
204.

Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not.
 "Equine-assisted" or "equine-facilitated" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes.
.
205.
 There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings.
 Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.

Horses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history.
 The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC,.
207.
 and the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the Bronze Age.
.
208.
.
209.
 Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective.
 Horses have been used in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.
.
210.

Products
Horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.

Products collected from living horses include mare's milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis.
.
211.
 Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling.
 Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat.
.

 The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy.
.
212.
 The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.
.
213.

Horse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages.
 It is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures,.
214.
 and a subject of political controversy in others.

Care
Main article: Horse care
See also: Equine nutrition, Horse grooming, Veterinary medicine, and Farrier

Checking teeth and other physical examinations are an important part of horse care.

Horses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture.
.
222.
 They can consume approximately 2% to 2.
5% of their body weight in dry feed each day.
 Therefore, a 450-kilogram (990 lb) adult horse could eat up to 11 kilograms (24 lb) of food.
.
223.
 Sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active.
.
224.
 When grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should still be forage.
.
225.

Horses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of 10 US gallons (38 L) to 12 US gallons (45 L) per day.
.
226.
Although horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.
.
227.

Horses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dentalexaminations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist.
.
228.
 If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being.
.
229.
 When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained.
.
230.
 Regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.

The silkworm is the larva or caterpillar or imago of the domestic silkmoth, Bombyx mori (Latin: "silkworm of the mulberrytree").
 It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of silk.
 A silkworm's preferred food is white mulberryleaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even osage orange.
 Domestic silkmoths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding.
 Wild silkmoths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.

Sericulture, the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China,.
1.
 from where it spread to Korea and Japan, India and later the West.
 The silkworm was domesticated from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina, which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia.
 The domesticated silkworm derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.
.
2.
.
3.

Silkworms were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the Neolithic age.
 Before then, the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed.
 The domesticated B.
 mori and the wild B.
 mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.
.
4.
:342
Domestic silkmoths are very different than most members in the genus Bombyx; not only they have lost the ability to fly, but also their color pigments are lost.

Types.
edit.

Mulberry silkworms can be categorized into three different but connected groups or types.
 The major groups of silkworms fall under the univoltine ("uni-"=one, "voltine"=brood frequency) and bivoltine categories.
 The univoltine breed is generally linked with the geographical area within greater Europe.
 The eggs of this type hibernate during winter due to the cold climate, and cross-fertilize only by spring, generating silk only once annually.
 The second type is called bivoltine and is normally found in China, Japan, and Korea.
 The breeding process of this type takes place twice annually, a feat made possible through the slightly warmer climates and the resulting two life cycles.
 The polyvoltine type of mulberry silkworm can only be found in the tropics.
 The eggs are laid by female moths and hatch within nine to 12 days, so the resulting type can have up to eight separate life cycles throughout the year.
.
6.

Process.
edit.


Adult silk moth

Wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina
Eggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously.
 They have a preference for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone.
 They are not monophagous since they can eat other species of Morus, as well as some other Moraceae, mostly Osage orange.
 They are covered with tiny black hairs.
 When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to molt.
 After molting, the instar phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.

After they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow and the skin becomes tighter.
 The larvae then prepare to enter the pupal phase of their lifecycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the salivary glands.
 The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state.
 Many other Lepidoptera produce cocoons, but only a few¡Xthe Bombycidae, in particular the Bombyx genus, and the Saturniidae, in particular the Antheraea genus¡Xhave been exploited for fabric production.

If the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupal phase of its lifecycle, it releases proteolytic enzymes to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth.
 These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which seriously reduces the value of the silk threads, but not silk cocoons used as "stuffing" available in China and elsewhere for doonas, jackets etc.
 To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled.
 The heat kills the silkworms and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel.
 Often, the silkworm itself is eaten.

As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larvae, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists.
 Mahatma Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the Ahimsa philosophy "not to hurt any living thing".
 This led to Gandhi's promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute.
 He also promoted Ahimsa silk, wild silk made from the cocoons of wild and semiwild silkmoths.
.

 Ahimsa silk is promoted in parts of southern India for those who prefer not to wear silk produced by killing silkworms.

 Ahimsa silk is also known as peace silk.
 In the early 21st century, the organization PETA has campaigned against silk.

The moth ¡V the adult phase of the lifecycle ¡V is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild B.
 mandarina and other Bombyx species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators.
 Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved.
 This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings.
 However, some silkmoths can still fly.
.

 Silkmoths have a wingspan of 3¡V5 cm (1.

0 in) and a white, hairy body.
 Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (for they are carrying many eggs), but are similarly colored.
 Adult Bombycidae have reduced mouth parts and do not feed, though a human caretaker can feed them.

Cocoon.

Cocoon of B.
 mori
The cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from 300 to about 900 m (1,000 to 3,000 ft) long.
 The fibers are very fine and lustrous, about 10 £gm (0.
0004 in) in diameter.
 About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make a pound of silk (0.
4 kg).
 At least 70 million pounds of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.

 Perhaps the first study of a silkworm, it appeared in Hooke's Micrographia, 1665
Due to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a model organism in the study of lepidopteran and arthropod biology.
 Fundamental findings on pheromones, hormones, brain structures, and physiology have been made with the silkworm.

 One example of this was the molecular identification of the first known pheromone, bombykol, which required extracts from 500,000 individuals, due to the very small quantities of pheromone produced by any individual worm.

Currently, research is focusing on genetics of silkworms and the possibility of genetic engineering.
 Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 Mendelian mutations have been described.

 One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet.

 Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins.
 Bombyx mori females are also one of the few organisms with homologous chromosomes held together only by the synaptonemal complex (and not crossovers) during meiosis.

Researchers at the MIT Media Lab experimented with silkworms to see what they would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures.
 They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the worms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving directly onto the given shape.
 Using this knowledge they built a silk pavilion with 6,500 silkworms over a number of days.

Domestication.
edit.

The domesticated form, compared to the wild form, has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion.
 It has gained tolerance to human presence and handling, and also living in crowded conditions.
 The domesticated moth cannot fly, so it needs human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators.
 The native color pigments are also lost, so the domesticated moths are leucistic since camouflage isn't useful when they only live in captivity.
 These changes have made the domesticated strains entirely dependent upon humans for survival.
.
22.
 The eggs are kept in incubators to aid in their hatching.

Silkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view.
 The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance.
 Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop.
 Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage,.
25.
 shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones).
 Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval weight.
 Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights.
 Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.

Specific purposes apart from the commercial are researched in advanced countries to breed development for specific purposes like sericin production, sex-limited breeds, and thin/thick filament production.
 Disease-resistance breeding is important, as the major reason for crop losses is pathogen infection.
 Efforts are being made to select breeds which are tolerant or resistant to various pathogens.

Hobby raising and school projects.
edit.

In the US, teachers may sometimes introduce the insect life cycle to their students by raising silkworms in the classroom as a science project.
 Students have a chance to observe complete life cycles of insect from egg stage to larvae, pupa, moth.

The silkworm has been raised as a hobby in countries such as China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Iran.
 Children often pass on the eggs, creating a non-commercial population.
 The experience provides children with the opportunity to witness the life cycle of silkworms.
 The practice of raising silkworms by children as pets has, in non-silk farming South Africa, led to the development of extremely hardy landraces of silkworms, because they are invariably subjected to hardships not encountered by commercially farmed members of the species.
.
27.
 However, these worms, not being selectively bred as such, are possibly inferior in silk production and may exhibit other undesirable traits.

Genome.
edit.

The full genome of the silkworm was published in 2008 by the International Silkworm Genome Consortium.
.
13.
 Draft sequences were published in 2004.
.
28.
.
29.

The genome of the silkworm is mid-range with a genome size around 432 megabase pairs.

High genetic variability has been found in domestic lines of silkworms, though this is less than that among wild silkmoths (about 83 percent of wild genetic variation).
 This suggests a single event of domestication, and that it happened over a short period of time, with a large number of wild worms having been collected for domestication.
.
30.
 Major questions, however, remain unanswered: "Whether this event was in a single location or in a short period of time in several locations cannot be deciphered from the data".
 Research also has yet to identify the area in China where domestication arose.

Silkworm legends.
edit.

See also: Horse in Chinese mythology ¡± Origins of sericulture
In China, a legend indicates the discovery of the silkworm's silk was by an ancient empress Lei Zu, the wife of the Yellow Emperor and the daughter of XiLing-Shi.
 She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea.
 As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation.
 When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva.
 In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk.
 She taught this to the people and it became widespread.
 Many more legends about the silkworm are told.

The Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a Khotan prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, "hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry", probably in the first half of the first century AD.
.
34.
 About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms, in a hollow stick, out of China and sold the secret to the Byzantine Empire.

Silkworm diseases.
edit.

	Beauveria bassiana, a fungus, destroys the entire silkworm body.
	 This fungus usually appears when silkworms are raised under cold conditions with high humidity.
	 This disease is not passed on to the eggs from moths, as the infected silkworms cannot survive to the moth stage.
	 This fungus can spread to other insects.
	
	Grasserie, also known as nuclear polyhedrosis, milky disease, or hanging disease, is caused by infection with the Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus.
	 If grasserie is observed in the chawkie stage, then the chawkie larvae must have been infected while hatching or during chawkie rearing.
	 Infected eggs can be disinfected by cleaning their surfaces prior to hatching.
	 Infections can occur as a result of improper hygiene in the chawkie rearing house.
	 This disease develops faster in early instar rearing.
	
	Pebrine is a disease caused by a parasitic microsporidian, Nosema bombycis Nageli.
	 Diseased larvae show slow growth, undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite.
	 Tiny black spots appear on larval integument.
	 Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death.
	
	N.
	 bombycis kills 100% of silkworms hatched from infected eggs.
	 This disease can be carried over from worms to moths, then eggs and worms again.
	 This microsporidium comes from the food the silkworms eat.
	 If silkworms get this disease in their worm stage, no visible symptoms occur.
	 However, mother moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of worms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage.
	 To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.
	
Traditional Chinese medicine.
edit.

In traditional Chinese medicine, silkworm is the source of the "stiff silkworm", which is made from dried fourth- or fifth-instar larvae which have died of white muscardine disease (a lethal fungal infection).
 It is believed to dispel flatulence, dissolve phlegm, and relieve spasms.

The domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is a pigeon that was derived from the rock pigeon.
 The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird.
 Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do Egyptian hieroglyphics.

Reproduction.
edit.

Domestic pigeons reproduce in a similar way to the wild rock pigeon.
 Generally humans will select breeding partners.
 Crop milkproduced by parent birds may occasionally be replaced with artificial substitutes.
 Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process.
 Baby pigeons are called squeakers or squabs.

Group of pigeons
Trained domestic pigeons are able to return to the home loft if released at a location that they have never visited before and that may be up to 1000 km away.
 A special breed, called homing pigeons has been developed through selective breeding to carry messages and members of this variety of pigeon are still being used in the sport of pigeon racing and the white release dove ceremony at weddings and funerals.

The ability a pigeon has to return home from a strange location necessitates two sorts of information.
 The first, called "map sense" is their geographic location.
 The second, "compass sense" is the bearing they need to fly from their new location in order to reach their home.
 Both of these senses, however, respond to a number of different cues in different situations.
 The most popular conception of how pigeons are able to do this is that they are able to sense the Earth's magnetic field.

.
 Another theory is that pigeons have compass sense, which uses the position of the sun, along with an internal clock, to work out direction.
 However, studies have shown that if magnetic disruption or clock changes disrupt these senses, the pigeon can still manage to get home.
 The variability in the effects of manipulations to these sense of the pigeons indicates that there is more than one cue on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues.

For food.

Main article: Squab
Pigeons are also bred for meat, generally called squab and harvested from young birds.
 Pigeons grow to a very large size in the nest before they are fledged and able to fly, and in this stage of their development (when they are called squabs) they are prized as food.
 For commercial meat production a breed of large white pigeon, named "King pigeon," has been developed by selective breeding.
 Breeds of pigeons developed for their meat are collectively known as utility pigeons.

Exhibition breeds.

Main article: Fancy pigeon
Pigeon fanciers developed many exotic forms of pigeon.
 These are generally classed as fancy pigeons.
 Fanciers compete against each other at exhibitions or shows and the different forms or breeds are judged to a standard to decide who has the best bird.
 Among those breeds are the English carrier pigeons, a variety of pigeon with wattles and a unique, almost vertical, stance (pictures).
 There are many ornamental breeds of pigeons, including the "Duchess" breed, which has as a prominent characteristic feet that are completely covered by a sort of fan of feathers.
 The fantail pigeons are also very ornamental with their fan-shaped tail feathers.

 In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon by the majority of fanciers.
 None of the major clubs condone this practice.
 It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in Oregon and Washington, and that 1,000¡V2,000 are killed in southern Californiaannually.
 In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for killing birds of prey.
 Seven Californians and a Texan were also charged in the case.

In the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom pigeon fanciers have been blamed for a trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons.
 Eight illegal spring-loaded traps were found close to peregrine nests and at least one of the protected birds died.
 The steel traps are thought to have been set as part of a "concerted campaign" to kill as many of the birds as possible in the West Midlands.

Feral pigeons.

Main article: Feral pigeon

Feral rock pigeons commonly show a very wide range of plumage variation.

Many domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the feral pigeon.
 These show a variety of plumages, although some look very like pure rock pigeons.
 The scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds.
 Domestic pigeons can often be distinguished from feral pigeons because they usually have a metal or plastic band around one (sometimes both) legs which shows, by a number on it, that they are registered to an owner.

Origins and characteristics.
edit.

Farm goose: erect posture and fat rear end

Wild goose: horizontal posture and slim rear end
In Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the greylag goose Anser anser.
 In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoides; these are commonly known as Chinese geese.
 Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as Australia and North America) may consist of either species, and/or hybrids between them.
 Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob at the base of the bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between them.
.
1.

The domestication, as Charles Darwin remarks (The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication i.
 287), is of very ancient date, with archaeological evidence for domesticated geese in Egypt more than 4,000 years ago.
.
2.
 They are much larger, and they have been selected for that larger size, with domesticated breeds weighing up to 10 kilograms (22 lb),.
2.
compared to the maximum of 3.
5 kilograms (7.
7 lb) for the wild swan goose and 4.
1 kilograms (9.
0 lb) for the wild greylag goose.
.
3.
 This affects their body structure; whereas wild geese have a horizontal posture and slim rear end, domesticated geese lay down large fat deposits toward the tail end, giving a fat rear and forcing the bird into a more upright posture.
 Although their heavy weight affects their ability to fly, most breeds of domestic geese are capable of flight.

Geese have also been strongly selected for fecundity, with females laying up to 50 eggs per year, compared to 5¡V12 eggs for a wild goose.
.
2.
.
3.

As most domestic geese display little sexual dimorphism, sexing is based primarily on physical characteristics and behaviour.
 Males are typically taller and larger than females, and have longer necks.
 In addition, males can be distinguished by the protective behaviour they exhibit towards their mate and their offspring - the male will typically stand between their partner and any perceived threat.

Changes to the plumage are variable; many have been selected to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird.
 The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers.
 Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure.
 White geese are often preferred as they look better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous.
 From the time of the Romans, white geese have been held in great esteem.

Geese produce large edible eggs, weighing 120¡V170 grams (4.
2¡V6.
0 oz).
.
2.
 They can be used in cooking just like chicken's eggs, though they have proportionally more yolk, and this cooks to a slightly denser consistency.
 The taste is much the same as that of a chicken egg, but more gamey.

Like their wild ancestors, domestic geese are very protective of their offspring and other members of the flock.
 The gander will normally place himself between any perceived threat and his family.
 Owing to their highly aggressive nature, loud call and sensitivity to unusual movements, geese can contribute towards the security of a property.
.
4.
 In late 1950s South Vietnam, the VNAF used flocks of geese to guard their parked aircraft at night due to the noise they would make at intruders.
.
5.

Due to the fact that domestic geese descended from the Greylag goose are effectively the same species as their wild ancestor (being a subspecies formed through domestication), escaped individuals readily breed with wild populations, resulting in the offspring sometimes resembling either one of their parents, or bearing mixed plumage with patterns of grey and white feathers.

Etymology.
edit.

The English word "yak" is a loan originating from Tibetan: ????, Wylie: g.
yag.
 In Tibetan, it refers only to the male of the species, the female being called Tibetan: ?????, Wylie: 'bri, or nak.
 In English, as in most other languages that have borrowed the word, "yak" is usually used for both sexes.

Taxonomy.
edit.

Yaks belong to the genus Bos and are therefore related to cattle (Bos primigenius species).
 Mitochondrial DNA analyses to determine the evolutionary history of yaks have been inconclusive.

The yak may have diverged from cattle at any point between one and five million years ago, and there is some suggestion that it may be more closely related to bisonthan to the other members of its designated genus.
.
2.
 Apparent close fossil relatives of the yak, such as Bos baikalensis, have been found in eastern Russia, suggesting a possible route by which yak-like ancestors of the modern American bison could have entered the Americas.
.
3.

The species was originally designated as Bos grunniens ("grunting ox") by Linnaeus in 1766, but this name is now generally only considered to refer to the domesticated form of the animal, with Bos mutus ("mute ox") being the preferred name for the wild species.
 Although some authors still consider the wild yak to be a subspecies, Bos grunniens mutus, the ICZN made an official ruling in 2003.

 permitting the use of the name Bos mutus for wild yaks, and this is now the more common usage.

Except where the wild yak is considered as a subspecies of Bos grunniens, there are no recognised subspecies of yak.

Physical characteristics.
edit.


A domestic yak at Yamdrok Lake.

Yaks are heavily built animals with a bulky frame, sturdy legs, rounded cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur that hangs down lower than the belly.
 While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite variable in colour, often having patches of rusty brown and cream.
 They have small ears and a wide forehead, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour.
 In males (bulls), the horns sweep out from the sides of the head, and then curve forward.
 They typically range from 48 to 99 cm (19 to 39 in) in length.
 The horns of females (cows) are smaller, only 27 to 64 cm (11 to 25 in) in length, and have a more upright shape.
 Both sexes have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the shoulders, although this is larger and more visible in males.
.
3.
 Males weigh 350 to 580 kg (770 to 1,280 lb), females weigh 225 to 255 kg (496 to 562 lb).
 Wild yaks can be substantially heavier, bulls reaching weights of up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb).

Depending on the breed, domestic yak males are 111¡V138 centimetres (44¡V54 in) high at the withers, while females are 105¡V117 centimetres (41¡V46 in) high at the withers.
.
8.

Both sexes have long shaggy hair with a dense woolly undercoat over the chest, flanks, and thighs to insulate them from the cold.
 Especially in bulls, this may form a long "skirt" that can reach the ground.
 The tail is long and horselike rather than tufted like the tails of cattle or bison.
 Domesticated yaks have a wide range of coat colours, with some individuals being white, grey, brown, roan or piebald.
 The udder in females and the scrotum in males are small and hairy, as protection against the cold.
 Females have four teats.
.
3.

Yaks grunt and, unlike cattle, are not known to produce the characteristic bovine lowing (mooing) sound, which inspired the scientific name of the domestic yak variant, Bos grunniens (grunting bull).
 Nikolay Przhevalsky named the wild variant Bos mutus (silent bull), believing that it did not make a sound at all.

Physiology.
edit.

Yak physiology is well adapted to high altitudes, having larger lungs and heart than cattle found at lower altitudes, as well as greater capacity for transporting oxygen through their blood.
10.
 due to the persistence of foetal haemoglobin throughout life.
.
11.
 Conversely, yaks have trouble thriving at lower altitudes,.
12.
 and are prone to suffering from heat exhaustion above about 15 ¢XC (59 ¢XF).
 Further adaptations to the cold include a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, and an almost complete lack of functional sweat glands.
.
10.

Compared with domestic cattle, the rumen of yaks is unusually large, relative to the omasum.
.

 This likely allows them to consume greater quantities of low-quality food at a time, and to ferment it longer so as to extract more nutrients.
.
10.
 Yak consume the equivalent of 1% of their body weight daily while cattle require 3% to maintain condition.
.

Odour.
edit.

Contrary to popular belief, yak and their manure have little to no detectable odour.
13.
 when maintained appropriately in pastures or paddocks with adequate access to forage and water.
 Yak's wool is naturally odour resistant.
.
14.

Reproduction and life history.
edit.


Ten-day-old yak.

Yaks mate in the summer, typically between July and September, depending on the local environment.
 For the remainder of the year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance.
 In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns.
 Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung.
.
3.
 Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.
.
15.

Gestation lasts between 257 and 270 days,.
10.
 so that the young are born between May and June, and results in the birth of a single calf.
 The cow finds a secluded spot to give birth, but the calf is able to walk within about ten minutes of birth, and the pair soon rejoin the herd.
.
10.
 Females of both the wild and domestic forms typically give birth only once every other year,.
3.
 although more frequent births are possible if the food supply is good.

Calves are weaned at one year and become independent shortly thereafter.
 Wild calves are initially brown in colour, and only later develop the darker adult hair.
 Females generally give birth for the first time at three or four years of age,.
16.
 and reach their peak reproductive fitness at around six years.
 Yaks may live for more than twenty years in domestication or captivity,.
3.
 although it is likely that this may be somewhat shorter in the wild.

Hybrid yak.
edit.

In Nepal, Tibet and Mongolia, domestic cattle are crossbred with yaks.
 This gives rise to the infertile male dzo ???? as well as fertile females known as ???????dzomo or zhom, which may be crossed again with cattle.
 The "Dwarf Lulu" breed, "the only Bos primigenius taurus type of cattle in Nepal" has been tested for DNA markers and found to be a mixture of both taurine and zebu types of cattle (B.
 p.
 taurus and B.
 p.
 indicus) with yak.
.
17.
 According to the International Veterinary Information Service, the low productivity of second generation cattle-yak crosses makes them suitable only as meat animals.
.
18.

Crosses between yaks and domestic cattle (Bos primigenius taurus) have been recorded in Chinese literature for at least 2,000 years.
.
3.
 Successful crosses have also been recorded between yak and American bison,.
18.
 gaur, and banteng, generally with similar results to those produced with domestic cattle.

Relationship with humans.
edit.

Domesticated yaks have been kept for thousands of years, primarily for their milk, fibre and meat, and as beasts of burden.
 Their dried droppings are an important fuel, used all over Tibet, and are often the only fuel available on the high treeless Tibetan Plateau.
 Yaks transport goods across mountain passes for local farmers and traders as well as for climbing and trekking expeditions.
 "Only one thing makes it hard to use yaks for long journeys in barren regions.
 They will not eat grain, which could be carried on the journey.
 They will starve unless they can be brought to a place where there is grass.
".
19.
 They also are used to draw ploughs.
 Yak's milk is often processed to a cheese called chhurpi in Tibetan and Nepali languages, and byaslag in Mongolia.
 Butter made of yak's milk is an ingredient of the butter tea that Tibetans consume in large quantities,.
20.
 and is also used in lamps and made into butter sculptures used in religious festivities.
.
21.

Husbandry research.
edit.

The Indian government established a dedicated centre for research into yak husbandry, the ICAR-National Research Centre on Yak, in 1989.
 It is located at Dirang, Arunachal Pradesh, and maintains a yak farm in the Nyukmadung area at an altitude of 2750 m above MSL.
.
22.

Yak sports.
edit.


Yak racing
In parts of Tibet and Karakorum, yak racing is a form of entertainment at traditional festivals and is considered an important part of their culture.
 More recently, sports involving domesticated yaks, such as yak skiing or yak polo, are being marketed as tourist attractions in Central Asian countries, including in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan.

The Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) is a large, even-toed ungulate native to the steppes of Central Asia.
 The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, as does the wild Bactrian camel (a separate species), but in contrast to the single-humped dromedary camel.
.
2.
 Its population of two million exists mainly in the domesticated form.
.
3.
 Their name comes from the ancient historical region of Bactria.
.
4.

The domesticated Bactrian camel has served as a pack animal in inner Asia since ancient times.
 With its tolerance for cold, drought, and high altitudes, it enabled the travel of caravans on the Silk Road.
.
5.
 A small number of feral Bactrian camels still roam the Mangystau Province of southwest Kazakhstan and the Nubra Valley in India.

Phylogenetic relationships of the dromedary from combined analysis of all molecular data.
.
7.
 
The Bactrian camel shares the genus Camelus with the dromedary (C.
 dromedarius) and the wild Bactrian camel (C.
 ferus).
 The Bactrian camel belongs to the family Camelidae.
.
1.
.
8.
 The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first to describe the species of Camelus: in his 4th century BC History of Animals he identified the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel.
.
9.
.
10.
 The Bactrian camel was given its current binomial name Camelus bactrianus by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae.
.
11.

In 2007, Peng Cui (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and colleagues carried out a phylogenetic study of the evolutionary relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae: Camelini ¡X consisting of the three Camelusspecies (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) ¡X and Lamini ¡X consisting of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L.
 glama) and the vicuna (V.
 vicugna).
 The study revealed that the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), notably earlier than what had been previously estimated from North American fossils.
 Speciation began first in Lamini as the alpaca came into existence 10 million years ago (late Pleistocene).
 Nearly two million years later, the Bactrian camel and the dromedary emerged as two independent species.
.
7.

The Bactrian camel and the dromedary often interbreed to produce fertile offspring.
 Where the ranges of the two species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Iran and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding between them.
 The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the Bactrian camel and the dromedary should be merged into a single species with two varieties.
.
12.
 However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrialcytochrome b gene revealed that the species display 10.
3% divergence in their sequences.
.
13.

Differences from wild Bactrian camels.
edit.


Bactrian camels in Nubra Valley, India
The wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus) was first described by Nikolay Przhevalsky in the late 19th century and has now been established as a distinct species from the Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus).
.
14.
.
15.

Zoological opinion nowadays tends to favour the idea that C.
 bactrianus and C.
 dromedarius are descendants of two different subspecies of C.
 ferus (Peters and von den Driesch 1997: 652) and there is no evidence to suggest that the original range of C.
 ferus included those parts of Central Asia and Iran where some of the earliest Bactrian remains have been found.
.
16.

In particular, a population of wild Bactrian camel has been discovered to live within a part of the Gashun Gobi region of the Gobi Desert.
 This population is distinct from domesticated herds both in genetic makeup.
17.
 and in behavior.
.
citation needed.

As many as three regions in the genetic makeup are distinctly different from Bactrian camels, with up to a 3% difference in the base genetic code.
 However, with so few wild camels, what the natural genetic diversity within a population would have been is not clear.
.
citation needed.

Another difference is the ability of these wild camels to drink saltwater slush, although whether the camel can extract useful water from it is not yet certain.
 Domesticated camels are unable to drink such salty water.
.
18.

Description.
edit.


Detail of feet
The Bactrian camel is the largest mammal in its native range and is the largest living camel.
 Shoulder height is from 180 to 230 cm (5.
9 to 7.
5 ft), head-and-body length is 225¡V350 cm (7.
38¡V11.
48 ft), and the tail length is 35¡V55 cm (14¡V22 in).
 At the top of the humps, the average height is 213 cm (6.
99 ft).
 Body mass can range from 300 to 1,000 kg (660 to 2,200 lb), with males often being much larger and heavier than females.
.
3.
.
19.
 Its long, wooly coat varies in colour from dark brown to sandy beige.
 A mane and beard of long hair occurs on the neck and throat, with hairs measuring up to 25 cm (9.
8 in) long.
 The shaggy winter coat is shed extremely rapidly, with huge sections peeling off at once, appearing as if sloppily shorn.
 The two humps on the back are composed of fat (not water as is sometimes thought).
 The face is typical of a camelid, being long and somewhat triangular, with a split upper lip.
 The long eyelashes, along with the sealable nostrils, help to keep out dust in the frequent sandstorms which occur in their natural range.
 The two broad toes on each foot have undivided soles and are able to spread widely as an adaptation to walking on sand.
 The feet are very tough, as befits an animal of extreme environments.

Natural habitat.
edit.

These camels are migratory, and their habitat ranges from rocky mountain massifs to flat arid desert, stony plains, and sand dunes.
 Conditions are extremely harsh ¡V vegetation is sparse, water sources are limited and temperatures are extreme, ranging from as low as ?40 ¢XC in winter to 40 ¢XC in summer.
 The camels¡¦ distribution is linked to the availability of water, with large groups congregating near rivers after rain or at the foot of the mountains, where water can be obtained from springs in the summer months, and in the form of snow during the winter.

Life history.
edit.

Bactrian camels are exceptionally adept at withstanding wide variations in temperature, ranging from freezing cold to blistering heat.
 They have a remarkable ability to go without water for months at a time, but when water is available they may drink up to 57 liters at once.
 When well fed, the humps are plump and erect, but as resources decline, the humps shrink and lean to the side.
 When moving faster than a walking speed, they pace, by stepping forwards with both legs on the same side (as opposed to trotting, using alternate diagonals as done by most other quadrupeds).
 Speeds of up to 65 kilometres per hour (40 mph) have been recorded, but they rarely move this fast.
 Bactrian camels are also said to be good swimmers.
 The sense of sight is well developed and the sense of smell is extremely good.
 The lifespan of Bactrian camels is estimated at up to 50 years, often 20 to 40 in captivity.

Diet.
edit.

Bactrian camels are diurnal, sleeping in the open at night and foraging for food during the day.
 They are primarily herbivorous.
 With tough mouths that can withstand sharp objects such as thorns, they are able to eat plants that are dry, prickly, salty or bitter, and can ingest virtually any kind of vegetation.
 When other nutrient sources are not available, these camels may feed on carcasses, gnawing on bones, skin, or various different kinds of flesh.
 In more extreme conditions, they may eat any material they find, which has included rope, sandals, and even tents.
 Their ability to feed on a wide range of foods allows them to live in areas with sparse vegetation.
 The first time food is swallowed, it is not fully chewed.
 The partly masticated food (called cud) goes into the stomach and later is brought back up for further chewing.

Bactrian camels belong to a fairly small group of animals that regularly eat snow to provide their water needs.
 Any animals living above the snowline are obliged to do this, as snow and ice are the only forms of water during winter, and by doing so, their range is greatly enlarged.
 The latent heat of snow and ice is enormous compared with the heat capacity of water, demanding a large sacrifice in heat energy and forcing animals to eat only small amounts at a time.
.
20.

Reproduction.
edit.

Bactrian camels are induced ovulators ¡X they ovulate after insemination (insertion of semen into the vagina); the seminal plasma, not the spermatozoa, induces ovulation.
 Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 h and the rest by 48 h (the same as natural mating).
 The least amount of semen required to elicit ovulation is about 1.
0 ml.
.
21.

Males during mating time are often quite violent and may bite, spit, or attempt to sit on other male camels.
 The age of sexual maturity varies, but is usually reached at 3 to 5 years.
 Gestation lasts around 13 months.
 One or occasionally two calves are produced, and the female can give birth to a new calf every other year.
 Young Bactrian camels are precocial, being able to stand and run shortly after birth, and are fairly large at an average birth weight of 36 kg (79 lb).
 They are nursed for about 1.
5 years.
 The young calf stays with its mother for three to five years, until it reaches sexual maturity, and often serves to help raise subsequent generations for those years.
 Wild camels sometimes breed with domesticated or feral camels.

Relationship to humans.
edit.


Two Bactrian camels
The Bactrian camel is thought to have been domesticated (independent of the dromedary) sometime before 2500 BC in Northeast Afghanistan.
22.
 or southwestern Turkestan.
.
23.
 The dromedary camel is believed to have been domesticated between 4000 BC and 2000 BC in Arabia.
 As pack animals, these ungulates are virtually unsurpassed, able to carry 170¡V250 kg (370¡V550 lb) at a rate of 47 km (30 miles) per day, or 4 km/h (2 mph) over a period of four days.

Bactrian camels have been the focus of artwork throughout history.
 For example, western foreigners from the Tarim Basin and elsewhere were depicted in numerous ceramic figurines of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618¡V907).

United States imports.
edit.

Bactrian camels were imported to the US several times in the mid- to late 1800s, both by the US military and by merchants and miners, looking for pack animals sturdier and hardier than horses and mules.
 Although the camels met these needs, the United States Camel Corps was never considered much of a success.
 Having brought two shipments of less than 100 camels to the US, plans were made to import another 1,000, but the US Civil War interrupted this.
 Most surviving camels of these endeavors, both military and private, were merely turned loose to survive in the wild.
 As a result, small feral herds of Bactrian camels existed during the late 19th century in the southwest deserts of the United States.

Classification

A traditionally dressed Quechua girl with a llama in Cusco, Peru
Lamoids, or llamas (as they are more generally known as a group), consist of the vicuna (Vicugna vicugna, prev.
 Lama vicugna), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), Suri alpaca, and Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos, prev.
 Lama guanicoe pacos), and the domestic llama (Lama glama).
 Guanacos and vicunas live in the wild, while alpacas ¡V as well as llamas ¡V exist only as domesticated animals.
.
8.
 Although early writers compared llamas to sheep, their similarity to the camel was soon recognized.
 They were included in the genus Camelus along with alpaca in the Systema Naturae (1758) of Carl Linnaeus.
.
9.
 They were, however, separated by Georges Cuvier in 1800 under the name of lama along with the guanaco.
.
10.
 Alpacas and vicunas are in genus Vicugna.
 The genera Lama and Vicugna are, with the two species of true camels, the sole existing representatives of a very distinct section of the Artiodactyla or even-toed ungulates, called Tylopoda, or "bump-footed", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet.
 The Tylopoda consist of a single family, the Camelidae, and shares the order Artiodactyla with the Suina(pigs), the Tragulina (chevrotains), the Pecora (ruminants), and the Whippomorpha (hippos and cetaceans, which belong to Artiodactyla from a cladistic, if not traditional, standpoint).
 The Tylopoda have more or less affinity to each of the sister taxa, standing in some respects in a middle position between them, sharing some characteristics from each, but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxa.

A domestic llama
The 19th-century discoveries of a vast and previously unexpected extinct Paleogenefauna of North America, as interpreted by paleontologists Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope, and Othniel Charles Marsh, aided understanding of the early history of this family.
.
citation needed.
 Llamas were not always confined to South America; abundant llama-like remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in the Rocky Mountains and in Central America.
 Some of the fossilllamas were much larger than current forms.
 Some species remained in North America during the last ice ages.
 North American llamas are categorized as a single extinct genus, Hemiauchenia.
 Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000 years ago, in modern-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri, and Florida.
.
11.

The camelid lineage has a good fossil record.
 Camel-like animals have been traced from the thoroughly differentiated, modern species back through early Miocene forms.
 Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls.
.
citation needed.
 No fossils of these earlier forms have been found in the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of camelids, and that Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge.
 The formation of the Isthmus of Panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part of the Great American Interchange, where they evolved further.
 Meanwhile, North American camelids died out at the end of the Pleistocene.
.

Characteristics
The following characteristics apply especially to llamas.
 Dentition of adults:-incisors 1/3 canines 1/1, premolars 2/2, molars 3/2; total 32.
 In the upper jaw, a compressed, sharp, pointed laniariform incisor near the hinder edge of the premaxilla is followed in the male at least by a moderate-sized, pointed, curved true caninein the anterior part of the maxilla.
.
13.
 The isolated canine-like premolar that follows in the camels is not present.
 The teeth of the molar series, which are in contact with each other, consist of two very small premolars (the first almost rudimentary) and three broad molars, constructed generally like those of Camelus.
 In the lower jaw, the three incisors are long, spatulate, and procumbent; the outer ones are the smallest.
 Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars, which differ from those of Camelus in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge.

Picture of a Black Llama
The skull generally resembles that of Camelus, the larger brain-cavity and orbits and less-developed cranial ridgesbeing due to its smaller size.
 The nasal bones are shorter and broader, and are joined by the premaxilla.

Vertebrae:
	cervical 7,
	dorsal 12,
	lumbar 7,
	sacral 4,
	caudal 15 to 20.
	
The ears are rather long and slightly curved inward, characteristically known as "banana" shaped.
 There is no dorsal hump.
 The feet are narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having a distinct plantar pad.
 The tail is short, and fibre is long, woolly and soft.

In essential structural characteristics, as well as in general appearance and habits, all the animals of this genus very closely resemble each other, so whether they should be considered as belonging to one, two, or more species is a matter of controversy among naturalists.

The question is complicated by the circumstance of the great majority of individuals that have come under observation being either in a completely or partially domesticated state.
 Many are also descended from ancestors that have previously been domesticated, a state that tends to produce a certain amount of variation from the original type.
 The four forms commonly distinguished by the inhabitants of South America are recognized as distinct species, though with difficulties in defining their distinctive characteristics.

These are:
	the llama, Lama glama (Linnaeus);
	the alpaca, Vicugna pacos (Linnaeus);
	the guanaco (from the Quechua huanaco), Lama guanicoe (Muller); and
	the vicuna, Vicugna vicugna (Molina)
The llama and alpaca are only known in the domestic state, and are variable in size and of many colors, being often white, brown, or piebald.
 Some are grey or black.
 The guanaco and vicuna are wild, the former being endangered, and of a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below.
 They certainly differ from each other, the vicuna being smaller, more slender in its proportions, and having a shorter head than the guanaco.
 The vicuna lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, in the southern part of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia.
 Its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid.
 The fiber is extremely delicate and soft, and highly valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal.
 Alpacas are descended from wild vicuna ancestors, while domesticated llamas are descended from wild guanaco ancestors, though a considerable amount of hybridization between the two species has occurred.

Differential characteristics between llamas and alpacas include the llama's larger size, longer head, and curved ears.
 Alpaca fiber is generally more expensive, but not always more valuable.
 Alpacas tend to have a more consistent color throughout the body.
 The most apparent visual difference between llamas and camels is that camels have a hump or humps and llamas do not.

Llamas are ruminants.
 This means that they have a complex stomach with several compartments that allows them to consume lower quality, high cellulose foods.
 The stomach compartments allow for fermentation of tough food stuffs, followed by regurgitation and re-chewing.
 Unlike other ruminants who have four compartments (cows, sheep, goats), llamas have only three stomach compartments: the rumen, omasum, and abomasum.

In addition, the llama (and other camelids) have an extremely long and complex large intestine (colon).
 The large intestine's role in digestion is to reabsorb water, vitamins and electrolytes from food waste that is passing through it.
 The length of the llama's colon allows it to survive on much less water than other animals.
 This is a major advantage in arid climates where they live.
.
14.

Reproduction

Dam and her cria
Llamas have an unusual reproductive cycle for a large animal.
 Female llamas are induced ovulators.
.
15.
 Through the act of mating, the female releases an egg and is often fertilized on the first attempt.
 Female llamas do not go into estrus ("heat").
.
16.

Like humans, llama males and females mature sexually at different rates.
 Females reach puberty at about 12 months old; males do not become sexually mature until around three years of age.
.
17.

Mating
Llamas mate with the female in a kush (lying down) position, which is fairly unusual in a large animal.
 They mate for an extended time (20¡V45 minutes), also unusual in a large animal.
.
18.

Gestation
The gestation period of a llama is 11.
5 months (350 days).
 Dams (female llamas) do not lick off their babies, as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more than half an inch (1.
3 cm).
 Rather, they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns.
.
19.

Crias
A cria (from Spanish for "baby") is the name for a baby llama, alpaca, vicuna, or guanaco.
 Crias are typically born with all the females of the herd gathering around, in an attempt to protect against the male llamas and potential predators.
 Llamas give birth standing.
 Birth is usually quick and problem-free, over in less than 30 minutes.
 Most births take place between 8 am and noon, during the warmer daylight hours.
 This may increase cria survival by reducing fatalities due to hypothermia during cold Andean nights.
 This birthing pattern is speculated to be a continuation of the birthing patterns observed in the wild.
 Crias are up and standing, walking and attempting to suckle within the first hour after birth.
.
20.
.
21.
.
22.
 Crias are partially fed with llama milk that is lower in fat and salt and higher in phosphorus and calcium than cow or goat milk.
 A female llama will only produce about 60 ml (2.
1 imp fl oz) of milk at a time when she gives milk, so the cria must suckle frequently to receive the nutrients it requires.
.
23.

Breeding methods
In harem mating, the male is left with females most of the year.

For field mating, a female is turned out into a field with a male llama and left there for some period of time.
 This is the easiest method in terms of labor, but the least useful in terms of prediction of a likely birth date.
 An ultrasound test can be performed, and together with the exposure dates, a better idea of when the cria is expected can be determined.

Hand mating is the most efficient method, but requires the most work on the part of the human involved.
 A male and female llama are put into the same pen and mating is monitored.
 They are then separated and remated every other day until one or the other refuses the mating.
 Usually, one can get in two matings using this method, though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once.
 The separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llama's reproductive tract more sound.
 If the mating is not successful within two to three weeks, the female is mated again.

 (December 2016)
Llamas should be tested for pregnancy after mating at two to three, six and at least 12 weeks.

1.	For "spit" testing, bring the potentially pregnant dam to an intact male.
2.	 If the stud attempts to mate with her and she lies down for him within a fairly short period of time, she is not pregnant.
3.	 If she remains on her feet, spits, attacks him, or otherwise prevents his being able to mate, it is assumed she is probably pregnant.
4.	 This test gets its name due to the dam spitting at the male if she is pregnant.
5.	
6.	For progesterone testing, a veterinarian can test a blood sample for progesterone.
7.	 A high level can indicate a pregnancy.
8.	
9.	With palpation, the veterinarian or breeder manually feels inside the llama to detect a pregnancy.
10.	 Some risks to the llama exist, but it can be an accurate method for pregnancy detection.
11.	
12.	Ultrasound is the most accurate method for an experienced veterinarian, who can do an exterior examination and detect a fetus as early as 45 days.
13.	
Spit testing with an intact male is generally free and is usually accurate.
 However, some hormonal conditions in females can make them reject a male when they are in fact not pregnant, and, more rarely, accept a male when they are pregnant.
 Progesterone tests can give a high reading in some females with a hormonal problem that are in fact not pregnant.
 Neither of the previous methods, nor palpation, can give a reasonably accurate idea of the age of the fetus, while an ultrasound procedure can.
 In addition, an ultrasound procedure can distinguish between pregnancy and misleading physical conditions, or between a live and dead fetus.
 The disadvantages of an ultrasound procedure are cost, some training in the use of ultrasound equipment is required, and not all veterinarians have the equipment needed to perform the examination.

Nutrition
Options for feeding llamas are quite wide; a wide variety of commercial and farm-based feeds are available.
 The major determining factors include feed cost, availability, nutrient balance and energy density required.
 Young, actively growing llamas require a greater concentration of nutrients than mature animals because of their smaller digestive tract capacities.

Behavior

A pack llama in the Rocky Mountain National Park
Llamas, which are well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning, are very friendly and pleasant to be around.
 They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily.
 However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.
.
citation needed.

When correctly reared, llamas spitting at a human is a rare thing.
 Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and do sometimes spit at each other as a way of disciplining lower-ranked llamas in the herd.
 A llama's social rank in a herd is never static.
 They can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights.
 This is usually done between males to see which will become dominant.
 Their fights are visually dramatic, with spitting, ramming each other with their chests, neck wrestling and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance.
 The females are usually only seen spitting as a means of controlling other herd members.

While the social structure might always be changing, they live as a family and they do take care of each other.
 If one notices a strange noise or feels threatened, a warning bray is sent out and all others become alert.
 They will often hum to each other as a form of communication.

The sound of the llama making groaning noises or going "mwa" (/mwa?/) is often a sign of fear or anger.
 If a llama is agitated, it will lay its ears back.
 One may determine how agitated the llama is by the materials in the spit.
 The more irritated the llama is, the further back into each of the three stomach compartments it will try to draw materials from for its spit.

An "orgle" is the mating sound of a llama or alpaca, made by the sexually aroused male.
 The sound is reminiscent of gargling, but with a more forceful, buzzing edge.
 Males begin the sound when they become aroused and continue throughout the act of procreation ¡V from 15 minutes to more than an hour.

Guard behavior
Main article: Guard llama

Llama guarding sheep on the South Downs in West Sussex
Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then.
.
28.
.
29.
 They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent.
 Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.

Research suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one.
 Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock.
 A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation.
 Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing.
 Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.

Using llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers.
 The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama.
 Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.

Pre-Incan cultures
The Moche people frequently placed llamas and llama parts in the burials of important people, as offerings or provisions for the afterlife.
.
32.
 The Moche culture of pre-Columbian Peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics.

Inca empire
In the Inca empire, llamas were the only beasts of burden, and many of the people dominated by the Inca had long traditions of llama herding.
 For the Inca nobility, the llama was of symbolic significance, and llama figures were often buried with the dead.
.
33.
 In South America, llamas are still used as beasts of burden, as well as for the production of fiber and meat.
.
34.

The Inca deity Urcuchillay was depicted in the form of a multicolored llama.
.
35.

Scholar Alex Chepstow-Lusty has argued that the switch from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to widespread agriculture was only possible because of the use of llama dung as fertilizer.

The first image of llamas in Europe, 1553
One of the main uses for llamas at the time of the Spanish conquest was to bring down ore from the mines in the mountains.
.
37.
Gregory de Bolivar estimated that in his day, as many as 300,000 were employed in the transport of produce from the Potosimines alone, but since the introduction of horses, mules, and donkeys, the importance of the llama as a beast of burden has greatly diminished.
.
38.

According to Juan Ignacio Molina, the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of chilihueques (possibly a llama type) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plow animals in 1614.
.
39.

Fiber
Llamas have a fine undercoat, which can be used for handicrafts and garments.
 The coarser outer guard hair is used for rugs, wall-hangings and lead ropes.
 The fiber comes in many different colors ranging from white or grey to reddish-brown, brown, dark brown and black.

The alpaca (Vicugna pacos) is a domesticated species of South American camelid.
 Alpacas are similar to llamas, and are often confused with them.
 The two animals are closely related, and can successfully cross-breed.
 They are also closely related to the vicuna, which is believed to be the alpaca's wild ancestor, and to the guanaco.

There are two breeds of alpaca: the Suri alpaca and the Huacaya alpaca.

Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of southern Peru, western Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Chile at an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft) to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) above sea level, throughout the year.
.
1.
 Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be beasts of burden, but were bred specifically for their fiber.
 Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to wool.
 These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding in other parts of the world.
 The fiber comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru, 12 as classified in Australia and 16 as classified in the United States.

Alpacas have several different components to how they behave.
 They depend on their body communication to get their point across when they are threatened or happy.
 They spit when they are in distress, fearful, or to show dominance.
.
2.
 Male alpacas tend to behave more aggressively than females, and they try to establish dominance of their herd group.

In the textile industry, "alpaca" primarily refers to the hair of Peruvian alpacas, but more broadly it refers to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca hair, but now often made from similar fibers, such as mohair, Icelandic sheep wool, or even high-quality wool.
 In trade, distinctions are made between alpacas and the several styles of mohair and luster.
.
3.

An adult alpaca generally is between 81¡V99 centimetres (32¡V39 in) in height at the shoulders (withers).
 They usually weigh 48¡V84 kilograms (106¡V185 lb).

Background.
edit.


Guanacos (wild parent species of llamas) near Torres del Paine, Chile
Alpacas have been domesticated for thousands of years.
 The Moche people of northern Peru often used alpaca images in their art.
.
4.
 There are no known wild alpacas, and its closest living relative, the vicuna (also native to South America), are believed to be the wild ancestor of the alpaca.
.
5.
 The alpaca is larger than the vicuna, but smaller than the other camelid species.

Along with camels and llamas, alpacas are classified as camelids.
 Of the various camelid species, the alpaca and vicuna are the most valuable fiber-bearing animals: the alpaca because of the quality and quantity of its fiber, and the vicuna because of the softness, fineness and quality of its coat.
.
3.

Alpacas are too small to be used as pack animals.
 Instead, they are bred exclusively for their fiber and meat.
 Alpaca meat was once considered a delicacy by Andean inhabitants.
 Because of the high price commanded by alpaca on the growing North American market, illegal alpaca smuggling had become a growing problem as of 2005.
.
6.
 In 2014, a company was formed claiming to be the first to export US-derived alpaca products to China.
.
7.

Alpacas and llamas can successfully cross-breed.
 The resulting offspring are called huarizo, which are valued for their unique fleece and gentle dispositions.

Evolution.
edit.

The family of Camelidaes first arose in Americas 40¡V45 million years ago during the Eocene period from the common ancestor, Protylopus.
.
8.
 30 million years after the Family first came to be it diverged into Camelini and Lamini, the tribes took different migratory patterns to cross into what we now know as Asia and into South America respectively.
 Although the Camelids became extinct in North America around 3 million years ago their cousins in the South flourished into the tribes we see today.
.
9.
 It wasn't until 2¡V5 million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch that the genus Hemiauchenia of the tribe Lamini split into Palaeolama and Lama, the latter would then split again into Lama and Vicugna upon migrating down to South America.
.
8.

The remains of the Vicugna vicugna and Lama guanaco have been found throughout Peru for around 12,000 years.
 Their domesticated counterparts, the llama and alpacas have been found mummified in the Moquegua valley in the south of Peru dating back 900 to 1000 years.
 Mummies found in this region have allowed for two breeds of alpacas.
 More precise analysis of bone and teeth of these mummies have allowed some researchers to posit that alpacas were domesticated from the Vicugna vicugna.
 Other research, considering the behavioral and morphological characteristics of alpacas and their wild counterparts, seems to indicate that alpacas could find their origins in Lama guanicoe as well as Vicugna vicugna, or even a hybrid of both.
.
8.

Mitochondrial DNA paints a different picture for the origins of the alpaca.
 mtDNA research shows that alpacas are descendants of the Vicugna vicugna, not of the Lama guanicoe.
 Even leading to movements for the alpaca to be reclassified to Vicugna pacos.
.
8.

Breeds.
edit.

Alpacas come in two breeds Suri and Huacaya.
 For alpacas, breeds don't represent conventional, or European classifications, for breeds.
 Instead of taking into account a stud book or registry, alpacas are classified by their fibers.
 Even back to the earliest found alpacas, these distinctions in fibers can be isolated at fleece diameter at 23.
6 um and 17.
9 um.
 Presently however these fibers are more on the order of 31.
2 um and 26.
8 um.
.
10.

Huacaya alpacas have a denser fleece than their Suri counterparts.
 They are also the most common kind of alpaca found, about 90% of the population.
.
10.
 The Huacaya alpaca is thought to have originated in post-colonial Peru.
 This is due to their thicker fleece which makes them more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the Andes after being pushed into the highlands of Peru when conquistadors began taking over.
.
11.

Suri alpacas represent a smaller portion of the total alpaca population, around 10%.
.
10.
 They are thought to have been more prevalent in pre-Columbian Peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece not needed for extenuating weather conditions.
.
11.

Behavior.
edit.


Closeup of an alpaca's face
Alpacas are social herd animals that live in family groups consisting of a territorial alpha male, females and their young.
 Alpacas warn the herd about intruders by making sharp, noisy inhalations that sound like a high-pitched bray.
 The herd may attack smaller predators with their front feet, and can spit and kick.
 Their aggression towards members of the canid family (coyotes, foxes, dogs etc.
) is exploited when alpacas are used as guard llamas for guarding sheep.
.
12.

Alpacas can sometimes be aggressive, but they can also be very gentle, intelligent, and extremely observant.
 For the most part, alpacas are very quiet but male alpacas are more energetic in a sense where they get involved in fighting with other alpacas.
.
13.
 When they prey, they are cautious but also nervous when they feel any type of threat.
 They can feel threatened when a person or another alpaca comes up from behind them.
.
14.

Alpacas set their own boundaries of "personal space" within their families and groups.
.
15.
 They make a hierarchy in some sense, and each alpaca is aware of the dominant animals in each group.
.
13.
 Body language is the key to their communication.
 It helps to maintain their order.
 One example of their body communication includes a pose named broadside where their ears are pulled back and they stand sideways which is used when male alpacas are defending their territory.
.
2.

When they are young, they tend to follow larger objects and to sit near or under the large objects, for example a baby alpaca with its mother.
 This can also apply when an alpaca passes by any other older alpaca.
.
15.

Spitting.
edit.

Not all alpacas spit, but all are capable of doing so.
 "Spit" is somewhat euphemistic; occasionally the projectile contains only air and a little saliva, although alpacas commonly bring up acidic stomach contents (generally a green, grassy mix) and project it onto their chosen targets.
 Spitting is mostly reserved for other alpacas, but an alpaca will also occasionally spit at a human.

Spitting can result in what is called "sour mouth".
 Sour mouth is characterized by a loose-hanging lower lip and a gaping mouth.
 This is caused by the stomach acids and unpleasant taste of the contents as they pass out of the mouth.
.
citation needed.

Alpacas can spit for several reasons.
 A female alpaca spits when she knows she's not interested in a male alpaca.
 Both genders of alpaca keep others away from their food or anything they have their eyes on.
 Spitting can also happen when an alpaca is trying to warn any threats away.
 But there are also those alpacas that will spit just to spit whenever they feel like it.
 Most give a slight warning before they just go ahead and spit.
 They basically blow air out and raise their heads where it looks like their ears are pinned and make a little noise then there comes the saliva.
.
15.

Alpacas can spit out to ten feet if they need to, for example if the other animal does not back off then it will throw up its stomach insides resulting in a lot of spit.
 Alpacas, themselves, actually do not like the taste of their food so they just leave their mouths wide open until it¡¦s all gone.
.
16.

A couple signs of stress which can lead to their spitting habits include: humming, a wrinkle under their eye, drooling, rapid breathing, and stomping their feet.
 When an alpaca is showing any sign of interest or alertness, they tend to sniff their surroundings, watches closely, and they even just stand quietly and stare.
.
16.

When it comes to reproduction, they spit because it is a response triggered by the progesterone levels being increased which is associated with the ovulation.
.
17.

Hygiene.
edit.

Alpacas are in general very organized and neat.
 When they defecate they usually designate one place, even if they need to walk farther away.
 They use a communal dung pile.
.
18.
 Their waste is collected and used as garden fertilizer or even natural fertilizer.
.
2.

Another factor that goes into alpaca hygiene.
19.
 is their tooth care.
 When observing the teeth of an alpaca, it is a good way to tell if they have a healthy digestive system.
 Alpacas have their full set of adult teeth by the age of six.
 Male alpacas have 32 teeth and female alpacas have 30 teeth.
 Males have those extra two teeth because they are called their fighting teeth and female alpacas do not have those unless they are rare species.
 Alpacas have six lower incisors which help them bite off plants to chew.
 They do not have any upper incisors, but their mouths are lined up perfectly so that they have the ability to eat grass, hay, and plants.

There are warning signs to when an alpaca may have dental hygiene problems.
 One way to tell is if they take a while to chew their grass or hay or when they are eating, they continue to spill all their food and not keep it in their mouths.
 Another sign can be the poor body condition and if their cheeks are pushed in.

Alpacas use a communal dung pile, where they do not graze.
 This behaviour tends to limit the spread of internal parasites.
 Generally, males have much tidier, and fewer dung piles than females, which tend to stand in a line and all go at once.
 One female approaches the dung pile and begins to urinate and/or defecate, and the rest of the herd often follows.

Because of their preference for using a dung pile, some alpacas have been successfully house-trained.
.

Sounds.
edit.


Suri alpacas
Alpacas make a variety of sounds they make to communicate what they are thinking or feeling with each other.
.
20.
 They can get triggered by almost anything because they are so cautious about their surroundings.

	Humming: When alpacas are born, the mother and its child hum constantly.
	 They also hum as a sign of distress, especially when they are separated from their herd.
	 A couple other reasons alpacas will hum is if they are curious, happy, worried or cautious.
	
	Snorting: Alpacas snort when another alpaca is invading their space.
	
	Grumbling: Alpacas grumble to warn each other for example when one has gotten into their space and coming too close.
	 It sounds like they are gurgling.
	
	Clucking: Similar to a hen¡¦s cluck, alpacas cluck when a mother is concerned for her cria or male alpacas will cluck to signal friendly behavior.
	.
	2.
	
	Screaming: Their screams are extremely deafening and loud.
	 They will scream when they are not handled right or when they are being attacked by a potential enemy.
	
	Screeching: Bird-like cry, presumably intended to terrify the opponent.
	 This sound is typically used by a male alpaca when they are in a fight over who will dominate.
	 When female screeches, it is more of a growl when they are angry.
	
	Orgling: This sound is made when alpacas are mating.
	
Reproduction.
edit.

Females are induced ovulators;.
21.
 the act of mating and the presence of semen causes them to ovulate.
 Females usually conceive after just one breeding, but occasionally do have trouble conceiving.
 Artificial insemination is technically difficult, but it can be accomplished.
 Alpacas conceived from artificial insemination are not registerable with the Alpaca Registry.
.
22.

A male is usually ready to mate for the first time between two and three years of age.
 A female alpaca may fully mature (physically and mentally) between 10 and 24 months.
 It is not advisable to allow a young female to be bred until she is mature, and has reached two-thirds of her mature weight.
 Over-breeding a young female before conception is possibly a common cause of uterine infections.
 As the age of maturation varies greatly between individuals, it is usually recommended that novice breeders wait until females are 18 months of age or older before initiating breeding.
.
23.

Alpacas can breed at any time but it is more difficult to breed in the winter.
 Most breed during Autumn or late Spring.
.
24.
 Females mate based on their weight and age but since owners cannot necessarily weigh their alpacas, they breed when they are a year old.
 The most popular way to have alpacas mate is pen mating.
.
 Pen mating is when they grab both the female and the desired male into a pen.
 Another way is paddock mating where one male alpaca is let loose in the paddock with several female alpacas.
.
24.

In some countries, they usually do not mate until they approach the age of 2 years old.
 Alpacas, unlike other animals, do not have a menstrual or a seasonal cycle.
 They just have these induced ovulators which means that the eggs are released in reaction to mating.

Most pregnancies are implanted in the left uterine horn.
 This makes it so that the embryos must travel from the right to the left uterine horn.
 Rejection of the male Is a good sign that there is a chance of pregnancy.
 There is not any external body appearance that shows a female alpaca pregnant.
 .
17.

The gestation period is, on average, 11.
5 months, and usually results in a single offspring, or cria.
 Twins are rare, occurring about once per 1000 deliveries.
.
25.
 Cria are generally between 15 and 19 pounds, and are standing 30 to 90 minutes after birth.
.
26.
 After a female gives birth, she is generally receptive to breeding again after about two weeks.
 Crias may be weaned through human intervention at about six months old and 60 pounds, but many breeders prefer to allow the female to decide when to wean her offspring; they can be weaned earlier or later depending on their size and emotional maturity.

The average lifespan of an alpaca is between 15¡V20 years, and the longest-lived alpaca on record is 27 years.
.
27.

Habitat and lifestyle.
edit.

Alpacas can be found all over South America.
 Since they are currently domesticated, they are no longer living anywhere in the wild.
 They typically live in temperate conditions in the mountains with high altitudes, but after people started to take them in as pets they adapted to any climate and area.
 A prime example of this adaptation is the fact that they were used to living high up in the mountains with cooler weather but now they are living in places where it is hot and dry.
.
28.

They are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment.
 Animals such as, flamingos, condors, spectacled bears, mountain lions, coyotes, llamas, and sheep live near alpacas when they are in their natural habitat.
 People who own Alpacas tend to keep them in herds alongside sheep.
.
29.
 The main reason why Alpacas and sheep are kept together is so the alpacas can protect the sheep when they are eating grass throughout the day.
 They chase the predators away to insure the sheep¡¦s safety.

Today most alpacas are kept on farms for their fiber.
Since they are friendly and easy to maintain, statistics have shown an increase in the number of people taking them in as pets rather than strictly using them as a profit.
.
30.
 Although they are kept as pets they still need a big enough area for them to roam around.
 They like to drink a lot of water in order to keep cool in those hot and dry weather conditions that they were not originally used to.
.
31.

Population.
edit.

Since alpacas are native to Peru, they currently have the largest population of alpacas in the world.
 About eighty-seven percent of the 3,685,516 million Alpaca population inhabits Peru.

 Their population declined drastically after the Spanish conquest where they invaded the Andes mountains in 1532, after they arrived they murdered 98% of these animals and also brought over diseases that killed them.
.
33.

As a result of this invasion the Alpacas were forced to move higher into the mountains and ended up residing there for good.
 Although this invasion almost completely wiped out their population, they were rediscovered sometime during the 19th century by Europeans.
 After finding use for alpacas they became important to societies during the industrial revolution.
.
34.

Today, alpacas can be found all over Australia.
 While they might not have a very large population, they do have one of the largest breeding farms.
 Their population was introduced when they were smuggled out of South America in order to use their fiber to contribute to the wool market in Australia.

Diet.
edit.


(video) An Alpaca chewing
Alpacas chew their food which ends up being mixed with their cud and saliva and then they swallow it.
 They bring up the cud and chew it while they are resting.
 They end up spending a third of their day just looking and collecting their food.
 Alpacas usually eat 1.
5%.
36.
 of its body weight for normal growth.
 They mainly need pasture grass, hay, or silage but some may also need supplemental energy and protein foods and they will also normally try to chew on almost anything (e.
g.
 empty bottle).
 Most alpaca ranchers rotate their feeding grounds so the grass can regrow and fecal parasites may die before reusing the area.
 Pasture grass is a great source of protein.
 When seasons change, the grass loses or gains more protein.
 For example, in the spring, the pasture grass has about 20% protein while in the summer, it only has 6%.
.
37.
 They need more energy supplements in the winter to produce body heat and warmth.
 They get their fiber from hay or from long stems which provides them with vitamin E.
 Green grass contains vitamin A and E.

Alpacas can eat natural unfertilized grass; however, ranchers can also supplement grass with low-protein grass hay.
 To provide selenium and other necessary vitamins, ranchers will feed their domestic alpacas a daily dose of grain.
.
38.
 Free-range alpacas may obtain the necessary vitamins in their native grazing ranges.

Digestion.
edit.

Alpacas are pseudoruminants and, like other camelids, have a three-chambered stomach; combined with chewing cud, this three-chambered system allows maximum extraction of nutrients from low-quality forages.
.
39.

Alpacas will chew their food in a figure eight motion, swallow the food, and then pass it into one of the stomach's chambers.
 The first and second chambers (called C1 and C2) are where the fermentation process begins digestion.
 The alpaca will further absorb nutrients and water in the first part of the third chamber.
 The end of the third chamber (called C3) is where the stomach secretes acids to digest food, and is the likely place where an alpaca will have ulcers, if stressed.
 The alpaca digestive system is very sensitive and must be kept healthy and balanced.
.
40.

Poisonous plants.
edit.

Many plants are poisonous to the alpaca, including the bracken fern, fireweed, oleander, and some azaleas.
 In common with similar livestock, others include: acorns, African rue, agave, amaryllis, autumn crocus, bear grass, broom snakeweed, buckwheat, ragweed, buttercups, calla lily, orange tree foliage, carnations, castor beans, and many others.
.
41.

History of the scientific name.
edit.


Shorn alpacas
The relationship between alpacas and vicunas was disputed for many years.
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, the four South American lamoid species were assigned scientific names.
 At that time, the alpaca was assumed to be descended from the llama, ignoring similarities in size, fleece and dentition between the alpaca and the vicuna.
 Classification was complicated by the fact that all four species of South American camelid can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
.
42.
The advent of DNA technology made a more accurate classification possible.

In 2001, the alpaca genus classification changed from Lama pacos to Vicugna pacos, following the presentation of a paper.
5.
 on work by Dr.
 Jane Wheeler et al.
 on alpaca DNA to the Royal Society showing the alpaca is descended from the vicuna, not the guanaco.

Fiber.
edit.

Main article: Alpaca fiber

Alpaca fleece is a lustrous and silky natural fiber.
 While similar to sheep¡¦s wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and bears no lanolin, which makes it hypoallergenic.
.
43.
.
44.
 Without lanolin, it does not repel water.
 It is also soft and luxurious.
 In physical structure, alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair, being very glossy.
.
3.
 The preparing, carding, spinning, weaving and finishing process of alpaca is very similar to the process used for wool.
 Alpaca fiber is also flame-resistant, and meets the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's standards.
.
45.

Alpacas are typically sheared once per year in the spring.
 Each shearing produces approximately five to ten pounds (2.
2¡V4.
5 kilograms) of fiber per alpaca.
 An adult alpaca might produce 50 to 90 ounces (1420¡V2550 grams) of first-quality fiber as well as 50 to 100 ounces (1420¡V2840 grams) of second- and third-quality fiber.

Working with the fiber can be difficult and requires skilled craftsmen in order to knit it properly.
 Handmade alpaca garments are generally rare, as most are machine made, and those that are truly well done can last for an extremely long time.
 As the fiber is soft and luxurious it is the fabric of choice of some high end alpaca knitwear and sweater companies.

Prices.
edit.

The price for American alpacas can range from US$50 for a castrated male (gelding) to US$500,000 for the highest of champions in the world, depending on breeding history, sex, and color.
.
46.
 According to an academic study,.
47.
 though, the higher prices sought for alpaca breeding stock are largely speculative and not supported by market fundamentals, given the low inherent returns per head from the main end product, alpaca fiber, and prices into the $100s per head rather than $10,000s would be required for a commercially viable fiber production herd.
.
48.
 Breeding stock prices in Australia have fallen from A$10,000¡V30,000 head in 1997 to an average of A$3,000¡V4,000 today.

It is possible to raise up to 25 alpacas per hectare (10 alpacas per acre),.
49.
 as they have a designated area for waste products and keep their eating area away from their waste area.
 However, this ratio differs from country to country and is highly dependent on the quality of pasture available (in many desert locations it is generally only possible to run one to three animals per acre due to lack of suitable vegetation).
 Fiber quality is the primary variant in the price achieved for alpaca wool; in Australia, it is common to classify the fiber by the thickness of the individual hairs and by the amount of vegetable matter contained in the supplied shearings.

Livestock.
edit.


A Bolivian man and his alpaca
Alpacas need to eat 1¡V2% of body weight per day, so about two 60 lb (27 kg) bales of grass hay per month per animal.
 When formulating a proper diet for alpacas, water and hay analysis should be performed to determine the proper vitamin and mineral supplementation program.
 Two options are to provide free choice salt/mineral powder, or feed a specially formulated ration.
 Indigenous to the highest regions of the Andes, this harsh environment has created an extremely hardy animal, so only minimal housing and predator fencing are needed.
.
50.
 The alpaca¡¦s three-chambered stomachs allow for extremely efficient digestion.
 There are no viable seeds in the manure, because alpacas prefer to only eat tender plant leaves, and will not consume thick plant stems; therefore, alpaca manure does not need composting to enrich pastures or ornamental landscaping.
 Nail and teeth trimming is needed every six to twelve months, along with annual shearing.

Similar to ruminants, such as cattle and sheep, alpacas have only lower teeth at the front of their mouths; therefore, they do not pull grass up by the roots.
 Rotating pastures is still important, though, as alpacas have a tendency to regraze an area repeatedly.
 Alpacas are fiber-producing animals; they do not need to be slaughtered to reap their product, and their fiber is a renewable resource that grows yearly.

Cultural presence.
edit.

Alpacas are closely tied to cultural practices for Andeans people.
 Prior to colonization the image of the alpaca was used in rituals and in their religious practices.
 Since the people in the region depended heavily on these animals for their sustenance, the alpaca was seen as a gift from Pachamama.
 Alpacas being used for their meat, fibers for clothing, and art, and their images in the form of conopas.

Conopas take their appearance from the Suri alpacas, with long locks flanking its sides and bangs covering the eyes, and a depression on the back.
 This depression is used in ritual practices, usually filled with coca leaves and fat from alpacas and lamas, to bring fertility and luck.
 While their use was prevalent before colonization, the attempts to convert the Andeans people to Catholicism lead to the acquisition of more than 3,400 conopas in Lima alone.

The origin of alpaca is depicted in legend that says they came to be in the world after a goddess fell in love with a man.
 The goddess¡¦ father only allowed her to be with her lover if he cared for her herd of alpacas.
 On top of caring for the herd he was to always carry a small animal for his entire life.
 As she come into our world the alpacas followed her.
 Everything was fine until the man set the small animal down and the goddess fled back to her home.
 On her way back home, the man attempted to stop her and her herd from fleeing.
 While he was not able to stop her from returning he was able to stop a few alpacas from returning.
 These alpacas who didn¡¦t make it back are seen today in the swampy lands in the Andes waiting for the end of world, so they may return to their goddess.

Domestic guineafowl, sometimes called pintades or gleanies, are poultry originating from Africa.
 They are the domesticated form of the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) and are related to other game birds such as the pheasants, turkeys and partridges.
 Although the timing of their domestication is unknown, there is evidence that domestic guineafowl were present in Greece by the 5th century BC.

They lay 25¡V30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest.
 Their eggs are small, dark and extremely thick-shelled.
 The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with other hens until large numbers of eggs have accumulated.
 The incubation period is 26¡V28 days, and the chicks are called "keets".
 As keets, they are highly susceptible to dampness (they are indigenous to the more arid regions of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass.
 After their first two to six weeks of growth, though, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl.

Sexing the birds is not as simple as telling a rooster from a hen chicken.
 When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger than those of the female, and only the female makes the two-note cry imitated as "Buck-wheat!" or "Pot-rack!" Aside from that, though, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance.

As domestics, guineafowl are valuable pest controllers, eating many insects.
 They are especially beneficial in controlling the Lyme disease-carrying deer tick, as well as wasp nests.
 While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other fowl to be used as a security system against birds of prey.
 They will call with their loud, high shrieking voices if concerned about intruders.
 They are highly social birds and tend to languish when alone.

Within the domesticated species, many color variations have been bred forth aside from the "pearl" or natural color of the helmeted guinea.
 These include white, purple, slate, chocolate, lavender, coral blue, bronze, pewter, buff dundotte, blonde, and various pieds.

It can be cooked using any recipe that calls for chicken, but is considered to be more flavorful and, because of its higher cost, is generally served at special occasions.
 It is particularly common in French and Italian recipes.

The Fuegian dog (Spanish: perro yagan, perro fueguino), also known as the Yaghan dog, is an extinct domesticated canid.
 It was a domesticated form of the culpeo, Lycalopex culpaeus, unlike other domesticated canids ¡V dogs, domesticated from the gray wolf Canis lupus, and the domesticated fox, from the red fox Vulpes vulpes.

There are very few surviving specimens of Fuegian dog.
 These include one in the Museo Salesiano Maggiorino Borgatello in Chile,.
citation needed.
 and another in the Fagnano Regional Museum in Tierra del Fuego.
.
1.

Characteristics.
edit.

Fuegian dogs had erect ears, sharp snout and a thick tail, tawny colored or entirely white.
 Surviving images show them to be a similar size to the wild culpeo, which weighs 5 to 13.
5 kg (11 to 30 lb), or roughly the size of a Shetland Sheepdog.
 Gauchoscalled Fuegian dogs "maned dogs" because of their resemblance to the maned wolf.
 Lucas Bridges described the Fuegian dog as "a stunted cross between an Alsatian police dog and a wolf".
.
2.

It was described by Captain Martial, who headed the 1883 scientific expedition to Cape Horn, as ¡§ugly, with long tawny hair and a sharp snout, it looks quite like a fox".
.
3.

Behaviour.
edit.

Although the Fuegian dog's distribution corresponded with that of the Yaghan people, individual animals were not loyal to their human owners.
 Julius Popper pointed out the canid's lack of loyalty: "I never saw them, no matter how large their number, take an aggressive attitude or defend their masters when these were in danger".
.
4.

Uses.
edit.

Fuegian dogs were not used to hunt guanaco.
 However, they might have been useful for hunting otters.
.
5.
 The dogs were also useful to humans in that they would gather around their owners to keep them warm.
 This was noted by Julius Popper: "The dogs placed themselves in a group around the small Onas, taking the shape of a kind of wrapping .
¡K.
 my opinion is that the Fuegian dogs are only useful to complete the defective garment of the Indian, or better, as the Ona¡¦s heating furniture".

Extermination.
edit.

In 1919, when Salesian missionary Martin Gusinde visited the Yaghans, he noticed their dogs were gone.
 The Fuegian dogs were exterminated because they "were dangerous to men and cattle¡¨.
 Their fierce nature was also noted by Thomas Bridges in the 1880s, who wrote that they attacked his Mission¡¦s goats.

The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is the domesticated form of the European polecat, a mammal belonging to the same genusas the weasel, Mustela of the family Mustelidae.
.
1.
 They typically have brown, black, white, or mixed fur.
 They have an average length of 51 cm (20 in) including a 13 cm (5.
1 in) tail, weigh about 1.
5¡V4 pounds (0.
7¡V2 kg), and have a natural lifespan of 7 to 10 years.
.
2.
 Ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with males being substantially larger than females.

Several other Mustelids also have the word ferret in their common names, including an endangered species, the black-footed ferret.

The history of the ferret's domestication is uncertain, like that of most other domestic animals, but it is likely that ferrets have been domesticated for at least 2,500 years.
 They are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of the world, but increasingly, they are kept only as pets.

Being so closely related to polecats, ferrets easily hybridize with them, and this has occasionally resulted in feral colonies of polecat-ferret hybrids that have caused damage to native fauna, especially in New Zealand.
.
3.
 As a result, some parts of the world have imposed restrictions on the keeping of ferrets.

Etymology
The name "ferret" is derived from the Latin furittus, meaning "little thief", a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small items.
.
4.
 The Greek word ictis occurs in a play written by Aristophanes, The Acharnians, in 425 BC.
 Whether this was a reference to ferrets, polecats, or the similar Egyptian mongoose is uncertain.
.
5.

Biology
Characteristics

Ferret profile
Ferrets have a typical Mustelid body-shape being long and slender.
 Their average length is about 50 cm including a 13-cm tail.
 Their pelage has various colorations including brown, black, white or mixed.
 They weigh between 0.
7 kg to 2.
0 kg and are sexually dimorphic as the males are substantially larger than females.
 The average gestation period is 42 days and females may have 2 or 3 litters each year.
 The litter size is usually between 3 and 7 kits which are weaned after 3 to 6 weeks and become independent at 3 months.
 They become sexually mature at approximately 6 months and the average life span is 7 to 10 years.
.
6.
.
7.

Behavior
Ferrets spend 14¡V18 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are crepuscular.
.
8.
 Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily in social groups.
 A group of ferrets is commonly referred to as a "business".
.
9.
 They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer to sleep in an enclosed area.
.
10.

Like many other mustelids, ferrets have scent glands near their anus, the secretions from which are used in scent marking.
 Ferrets can recognize individuals from these anal gland secretions, as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals.
.
11.
 Ferrets may also use urine marking for sex and individual recognition.
.
12.

As with skunks, ferrets can release their anal gland secretions when startled or scared, but the smell is much less potent and dissipates rapidly.
 Most pet ferrets in the US are sold de-scented (anal glands removed).
.
13.
 In many other parts of the world, including the UK and other European countries, de-scenting is considered an unnecessary mutilation.

If excited, they may perform a behaviour called the "weasel war dance", characterized by frenzied sideways hops, leaps and bumping into nearby objects.
 Despite its common name, it is not aggressive but is a joyful invitation to play.
 It is often accompanied by a unique soft clucking noise, commonly referred to as "dooking".
.
14.
 When scared, ferrets will hiss; when upset, they squeak softly.
.
15.

Diet
Ferrets are obligate carnivores.
.
16.
 The natural diet of their wild ancestors consisted of whole small prey, including meat, organs, bones, skin, feathers, and fur.
.
17.
Ferrets have short digestive systems and quick metabolism, so they need to eat frequently.
 Prepared dry foods consisting almost entirely of meat (including high-grade cat food, although specialized ferret food is increasingly available and preferable).
18.
 provide the most nutritional value and are the most convenient,.
19.
 though some ferret owners feed pre-killed or live prey (such as mice and rabbits) to their ferrets to more closely mimic their natural diet.
.
20.
.
21.
 Ferret digestive tracts lack a cecumand the animal is largely unable to digest plant matter.
.
22.
 Before much was known about ferret physiology, many breeders and pet stores recommended food like fruit in the ferret diet, but it is now known that such foods are inappropriate, and may in fact have negative ramifications on ferret health.
 Ferrets imprint on their food at around six months old.
 This can make introducing new foods to an older ferret a challenge, and even simply changing brands of kibble may meet with resistance from a ferret that has never eaten the food as a kit.
 It is therefore advisable to expose young ferrets to as many different types and flavors of appropriate food as possible.
.
23.

Dentition

Ferret dentition
Ferrets have four types of teeth (the number includes maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) teeth) with a dental formula of 3/3 1/1 4/4 1/2:
	Twelve small teeth (only a couple of millimeters) located between the canines in the front of the mouth.
	 These are known as the incisors and are used for grooming.
	
	Four canines used for killing prey.
	
	Twelve premolar teeth that the ferret uses to chew food¡Xlocated at the sides of the mouth, directly behind the canines.
	 The ferret uses these teeth to cut through flesh, using them in a scissors action to cut the meat into digestible chunks.
	
	Six molars (two on top and four on the bottom) at the far back of the mouth are used to crush food.
	
Health

Male ferret
Ferrets are known to suffer from several distinct health problems.
 Among the most common are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system.
 Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza.
 Health problems can occur in unspayed females when not being used for breeding.
.
24.
 Certain health problems have also been linked to ferrets being neutered before reaching sexual maturity.

 Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome.
 Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems.

History of domestication

Women hunting rabbits with a ferretin the Queen Mary Psalter
In common with most domestic animals, the original reason for ferrets being domesticated by human beings is uncertain, but it may have involved hunting.
 According to phylogenetic studies, the ferret was domesticated from the European polecat (Mustela putorius), and likely descends from a North African lineage of the species.
.
25.
 Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggests that ferrets were domesticated around 2,500 years ago.
 It has been claimed that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate ferrets, but as no mummified remains of a ferret have yet been found, nor any hieroglyph of a ferret, and no polecat now occurs wild in the area, that idea seems unlikely.
.
26.

Ferrets were probably used by the Romans for hunting.
.
27.
.
28.

Colonies of feral ferrets have established themselves in areas where there is no competition from similarly sized predators, such as in the Shetland Islands and in remote regions in New Zealand.
 Where ferrets coexist with polecats, hybridization is common.
 It has been claimed that New Zealand has the world's largest feral population of ferret-polecat hybrids.
.
29.
 In 1877, farmers in New Zealand demanded that ferrets be introduced into the country to control the rabbit population, which was also introduced by humans.
 Five ferrets were imported in 1879, and in 1882¡V1883, 32 shipments of ferrets were made from London, totaling 1,217 animals.
 Only 678 landed, and 198 were sent from Melbourne, Australia.
 On the voyage, the ferrets were mated with the European polecat, creating a number of hybrids that were capable of surviving in the wild.
 In 1884 and 1886, close to 4,000 ferrets and ferret hybrids, 3,099 weasels and 137 stoats were turned loose.
.
30.
 Concern was raised that these animals would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once rabbit populations dropped, and this is exactly what happened to New Zealand's bird species which previously had had no mammalian predators.

Ferreting
Main article: Rabbiting

Muzzled ferret flushing a rat, as illustrated in Harding's Ferret Facts and Fancies (1915)
For millennia, the main use of ferrets was for hunting, or ferreting.
 With their long, lean build, and inquisitive nature, ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows.
 Caesar Augustus sent ferrets or mongooses (named viverrae by Plinius) to the Balearic Islands to control the rabbit plagues in 6 BC.
.
31.
.
32.
 In England, in 1390, a law was enacted restricting the use of ferrets for hunting to the relatively wealthy:
it is ordained that no manner of layman which hath not lands to the value of forty shillings a year shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or other dog to hunt, nor shall he use ferrets, nets, heys, harepipes nor cords, nor other engines for to take or destroy deer, hares, nor conies, nor other gentlemen's game, under pain of twelve months' imprisonment.
.
33.

Ferrets were first introduced into the New World in the 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West from rodents.
 They are still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom, where rabbits are considered a plague species by farmers.
.
34.
 The practice is illegal in several countries where it is feared that ferrets could unbalance the ecology.
 In 2009 in Finland, where ferreting was previously unknown, the city of Helsinki began to use ferrets to restrict the city's rabbit population to a manageable level.
 Ferreting was chosen because in populated areas it is considered to be safer and less ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbits.

Ferrets as pets

A ferret in a war dance jump.

In the United States, ferrets were relatively rare pets until the 1980s.
 A government study by the California State Bird and Mammal Conservation Program estimated that by 1996 about 800,000 domestic ferrets were being kept as pets in the United States.
.
35.

Like many household pets, ferrets require a cage.
 For ferrets, a wire cage at least 18 inches long and deep and 30 inches wide or longer is needed.
 Ferrets cannot be housed in environments such as an aquarium because of the poor ventilation.
.
36.
 It is preferable that the cage have more than one level but this is not crucial.
 Usually 2 to 3 different shelves are used.

Regulation

Terminology and coloring

Typical ferret coloration, known as a sable or polecat-colored ferret
Male ferrets are called hobs; female ferrets are jills.
 A spayed female is a sprite, a neutered male is a gib, and a vasectomised male is known as a hoblet.
 Ferrets under one year old are known as kits.
 A group of ferrets is known as a "business",.
59.
 or historically as a "busyness".
 Other purported collective nouns, including "besyness", "fesynes", "fesnyng", and "feamyng", appear in some dictionaries, but are almost certainly ghost words.

Most ferrets are either albinos, with white fur and pink eyes, or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestors.
 In recent years fancy breeders have produced a wide variety of colors and patterns.
 Color refers to the color of the ferret's guard hairs, undercoat, eyes, and nose; pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body, mask, and nose, as well as white markings on the head or feet when present.
 Some national organizations, such as the American Ferret Association, have attempted to classify these variations in their showing standards.

There are four basic colors.
 The sable (including chocolate and dark brown), albino, dark eyed white (DEW), and the silver.
 All the other colors of a ferret are variations on one of these four categories.

Waardenburg-like coloring

White or albino ferret
Ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers, and pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to Waardenburg syndrome.
 This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull, white face markings, and also partial or total deafness.
 It is estimated as many as 75 percent of ferrets with these Waardenburg-like colorings are deaf.

White ferrets were favored in the Middle Ages for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth.
 Leonardo da Vinci's painting Lady with an Ermine is likely mislabelled; the animal is probably a ferret, not a stoat, (for which "ermine" is an alternative name for the animal in its white winter coat).
 Similarly, the ermine portrait of Queen Elizabeth the First shows her with her pet ferret, which has been decorated with painted-on heraldic ermine spots.

"The Ferreter's Tapestry" is a 15th-century tapestry from Burgundy, France, now part of the Burrell Collection housed in the Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries.
 It shows a group of peasants hunting rabbits with nets and white ferrets.

Gaston Phoebus' Book of the Hunt was written in approximately 1389 to explain how to hunt different kinds of animals, including how to use ferrets to hunt rabbits.
 Illustrations show how multicolored ferrets that were fitted with muzzles were used to chase rabbits out of their warrens and into waiting nets.

Import restrictions
	Australia ¡V Ferrets cannot be imported into Australia.
	 A report drafted in August 2000 seems to be the only effort made to date to change the situation.
	.
	62.
	
	Canada ¡V Ferrets brought from anywhere except the US require a Permit to Import from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Animal Health Office.
	 Ferrets from the US require only a vaccination certificate signed by a veterinarian.
	 Ferrets under three months old are not subject to any import restrictions.
	.
	63.
	
	European Union ¡V As of July 2004, dogs, cats, and ferrets can travel freely within the European Union under the pet passport scheme.
	 To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead).
	 Vaccinations are required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some require a distemper vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry.
	 Ferrets occasionally need to be quarantined before entering the country.
	 PETS travel information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.
	
	United Kingdom ¡V The UK accepts ferrets under the EU's PETS travel scheme.
	 Ferrets must be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies, and documented.
	 They must be treated for ticks and tapeworms 24 to 48 hours before entry.
	 They must also arrive via an authorized route.
	 Ferrets arriving from outside the EU may be subject to a six-month quarantine.
	
	The Barbary dove, ringed turtle dove, ringneck dove, ring-necked turtle dove, or ring dove (Streptopelia risoria) is a domestic member of the dove family (Columbidae).
	
	Although the Barbary dove is normally assigned its own systematic name, as Streptopelia risoria, considerable doubt exists as to its appropriate classification.
	 Some sources confidently assert that it is a domestic form of the Eurasian collared dove, S.
	 decaocto, but the majority of evidence points to it being a domesticated form of the African collared dove, S.
	 roseogrisea.
	 It appears that it can hybridise freely with either species, and its status as a species must therefore be regarded as doubtful.
	 However, because of the wide use of both the common and systematic names, it is best to consider it separately from either of the putative parent species.
	 Their time of domestication is also uncertain.
	 While Linnaeus described them in 1756, they may have been imported into Italy from North Africa in the late 16th century.

	Barbary doves are easily kept and long-lived in captivity, living for up to 12 years.
	 However, there have been cases of doves living over 20 years,.
	2.
	 and, in one case, of a dove living for 29 years.

	 In recent years they have been used extensively in biological research, particularly into the hormonal bases of reproductive behaviour, because their sequences of courtship, mating and parental behaviour have been accurately described and are highly consistent in form.
	 Dove fanciers have bred them in a great variety of colours; the number of colours available has increased dramatically in the latter half of the twentieth century, and it is thought that this has been achieved by interbreeding with S.
	 roseogrisea.
	 Some of these doves carry a mutation that makes them completely white.
	 These white Barbaries are most commonly used in stage magic acts.
	 White Barbary doves are traditionally released in large public ceremonies, since it is a peace symbol in several cultures, and "dove releases" are also sometimes found at weddings and funerals.
	 However, a release dove is, in fact, usually a homing pigeon, as Barbary doves lack the homing instinct and will die left out in the wild.
	
	The coo of the Barbary dove is created by muscles that vibrate air sent up from the dove's lungs.
	 These muscles belong to the fastest known class of vertebrate muscles, contracting as much as ten times faster than muscles vertebrates use for running.
	 This class of muscles is usually found in high speed tissue such as a rattlesnake's tail.
	 Barbary doves are the first bird species to have been found to have this class of muscle.
	.

	Feral populations of Barbary doves establish themselves readily as a result of escapes or releases from captivity, but they will merge with local populations of Eurasian collared doves if they exist.
	 There is a small feral population in Los Angeles, California, where neither S.
	 decaocto nor S.
	 roseogrisea is currently found.
